<h2> ✂️ Splitting POWERPOINT Files Using Java APIs: Modular Slide Management for Dynamic Presentations</h2>

Splitting POWERPOINT files using Java APIs enables organizations to break large presentations into modular, reusable decks. This supports flexible training, marketing, and departmental communication with targeted, audience-specific slide content.

## ✅ Key Use Cases

- **Departmental Decks**: Segment full presentations into department-specific slides for internal meetings.
- **Training Modules**: Split comprehensive training decks into smaller modules for step-by-step learning.
- **Case Study Isolation**: Extract individual case studies from larger business presentations.

## ⚙️ Automation Scenarios

- **LMS Deployment**: Automate splitting slides for seamless integration into learning management systems.
- **Dynamic Slide Generation**: Create custom decks by combining reusable slide segments.
- **Modular Presentation Reuse**: Reuse slide sections across different events and audiences.
