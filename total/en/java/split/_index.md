Document splitting involves the segmentation of a single document or a sizable file into multiple smaller documents, determined by specific criteria such as page numbers, predefined patterns, content, or other factors. The requirement to split documents, whether by page number or defined patterns, arises from practical considerations. Additionally, document splitting serves multiple objectives, including improving document organization, simplifying data extraction, fostering collaboration, and meeting specific business or regulatory demands. This practice provides greater flexibility in document management, enhancing efficiency and user-friendliness in handling various types of documents.
