<h2> üìÑ Viewing DOC Files Using Java APIs: Secure and Dependable Document Previews</h2>

Viewing DOC files with Java APIs provides organizations a safe, read-only way to render Word documents without needing Microsoft Word installed. This approach supports HR, legal, and business systems where document integrity and confidentiality matter most.

## ‚úÖ Key Use Cases

- **Secure HR & Legal Previews:** Enable read-only DOC viewing for contracts, policies, or job applications.
- **Web-Based Job Applications:** Allow recruiters to preview resumes directly in browsers.
- **No Microsoft Word Dependency:** Display DOC content within portals and workflows without external software.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Scenarios

- **Browser-Based DOC Viewers:** Embed DOC rendering into intranets and dashboards.
- **Mobile-Friendly Previews:** Preview DOC files on Android/iOS HR apps.
- **Internal Compliance Systems:** Securely share DOC versions for audits or policy checks.
- **E-Learning Tools:** Display DOC-based lessons and resources within online courses.
