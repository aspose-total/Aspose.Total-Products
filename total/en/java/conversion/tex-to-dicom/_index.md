Converting a tex file to a DICOM image in Java can be done in two simple steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, to export the TEX file to a JPEG image. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDFs to other image formats. 

The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to a DICOM image. This API provides a comprehensive set of image processing features, including the ability to convert images to and from various formats, such as DICOM. It also provides a range of image manipulation features, such as resizing, cropping, and rotating images. 

Using these two APIs, you can easily convert a tex file to a DICOM image in Java. The Aspose.PDF for Java API provides the ability to export the TEX file to a JPEG image, while the Aspose.Imaging for Java API provides the ability to render the JPEG image to a DICOM image. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating PDF documents and images.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render TEX to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to DICOM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert TEX to DICOM in a Single File via Java" %}}
The API also allows you to export TEX file to DICOM to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your TEX document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to DICOM. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to DICOM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert TEX to DICOM With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export TEX file to DICOM with watermark in your DICOM document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert TEX to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as DICOM format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate TEX to DICOM File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output DICOM image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
