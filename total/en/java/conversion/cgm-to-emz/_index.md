Converting a CGM file to an EMZ image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the CGM file to a JPEG image. This API is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with documents, images, and other file formats. 

Once the CGM file has been converted to a JPEG image, the second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to an EMZ image. This API provides a powerful set of image processing tools that can be used to manipulate and convert images in a variety of formats. 

The combination of the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs makes it easy to convert a CGM file to an EMZ image in Java. With just two simple steps, you can quickly and easily convert a CGM file to an EMZ image. This makes it easy to work with CGM files in Java, allowing you to quickly and easily convert them to other image formats.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render CGM to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to EMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export CGM file to EMZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your CGM document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to EMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to EMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

Using the API, you can also export CGM file to EMZ with watermark in your EMZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert CGM to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as EMZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate CGM to EMZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output EMZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
