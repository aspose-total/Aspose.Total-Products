Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert EPUB to DIF. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the EPUB file to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents in Java applications. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to render EPUB to XLSX. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to DIF. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert spreadsheets in Java applications. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to convert XLSX to DIF. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate EPUB to DIF conversion feature into their Java applications. The two-step process of using Aspose.PDF for Java to render EPUB to XLSX and then using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to DIF is simple and straightforward. With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily add this feature to their applications.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to DIF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your EPUB document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting EPUB file to DIF, you can also add watermark to your output DIF file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as DIF with Watermark.
