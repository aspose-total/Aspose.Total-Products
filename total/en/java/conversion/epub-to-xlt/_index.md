Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate EPUB to XLT conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite consists of two components, namely Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to render EPUB to XLSX. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, converting, and manipulating PDF documents. It also supports various file formats such as DOCX, XLSX, HTML, and EPUB. 

Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to convert XLSX to XLT. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, and manipulating spreadsheets. It also supports various file formats such as XLSX, XLS, CSV, and XLT. 

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate EPUB to XLT conversion feature in their Java applications. The two-step process involves rendering EPUB to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for Java and then converting XLSX to XLT using Aspose.Cells for Java. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily integrate EPUB to XLT conversion feature in their applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected EPUB to XLT via Java" %}}
If your EPUB document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLT without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB File to XLT with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB file to XLT, you can also add watermark to your output XLT file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLT with Watermark.
