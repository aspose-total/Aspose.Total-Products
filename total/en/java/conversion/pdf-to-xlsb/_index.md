By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can integrate PDF to XLSB conversion feature in your Java applications in two-step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) you can render PDF to XLSX. In the second step, you can convert XLSX to XLSB by using Spreadsheet Programming API [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/).

If your PDF document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSB without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF File to XLSB with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting PDF file to XLSB, you can also add watermark to your output XLSB file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLSB with Watermark.
