Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate XPS to XLTX conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render XPS to XLSX. Once the XLSX file is created, the Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java is used to convert the XLSX file to XLTX. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents without any external dependencies. It supports a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, document signing, and more. It also provides the ability to render XPS to XLSX, which is the first step in the XPS to XLTX conversion process. 

The second step in the XPS to XLTX conversion process is to use Aspose.Cells for Java. This Spreadsheet Programming API enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets without any external dependencies. It supports a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, document signing, and more. It also provides the ability to convert XLSX to XLTX, which is the second step in the XPS to XLTX conversion process. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate XPS to XLTX conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render XPS to XLSX. Once the XLSX file is created, the Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java is used to convert the XLSX file to XLTX. This process is simple and efficient, and can be used to quickly and easily convert XPS to XLTX in Java applications.

If your XPS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTX without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting XPS file to XLTX, you can also add watermark to your output XLTX file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLTX with Watermark.
