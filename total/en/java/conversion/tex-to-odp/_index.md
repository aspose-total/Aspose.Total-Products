Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert TEX to ODP within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of APIs provides a powerful set of tools for manipulating documents, images, and other file formats.

The process of converting TEX to ODP begins with Aspose.PDF for Java. This API allows developers to export TEX to PPTX, a PowerPoint presentation format. Once the TEX file has been converted to PPTX, Aspose.Slides for Java can be used to convert the PPTX file to ODP. Aspose.Slides for Java is a PowerPoint Processing API that provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating PowerPoint presentations.

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert TEX to ODP. The process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which exports TEX to PPTX. Then, Aspose.Slides for Java is used to convert the PPTX file to ODP. This suite of APIs provides developers with a powerful set of tools for manipulating documents, images, and other file formats.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to ODP format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Odp` as SaveFormat

// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Odp format

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted TEX File via Java" %}}
While loading TEX file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open TEX document
Document doc = new Document("input.tex", "Your@Password");
// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save ODP File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting TEX to ODP, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Odp format
presentation.save("output.odp", SaveFormat.Odp);
