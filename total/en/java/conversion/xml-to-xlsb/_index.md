Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to integrate XML to XLSB conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which are two powerful APIs that can be used to render XML to XLSX and convert XLSX to XLSB respectively. 

The process of converting XML to XLSB involves two steps. Firstly, Aspose.PDF for Java can be used to render XML to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents in their Java applications. It also supports the conversion of XML to XLSX, which can be done by using the Document object model. 

In the second step, Aspose.Cells for Java can be used to convert XLSX to XLSB. This Spreadsheet Programming API provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in their Java applications. It also supports the conversion of XLSX to XLSB, which can be done by using the Workbook object model. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate XML to XLSB conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite of components provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents and spreadsheets in their Java applications. It also supports the conversion of XML to XLSB, which can be done in two steps by using Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java.

If your XML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSB without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting XML file to XLSB, you can also add watermark to your output XLSB file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLSB with Watermark.
