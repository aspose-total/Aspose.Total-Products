{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Remove Unused Information from a DOCM Document via Java" %}}
Before converting DOCM to FODS, you can remove unused information from DOCM Document via [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). Sometimes you may need to remove unused or duplicate information to reduce the size of the output document and processing time. The [CleanupOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/CleanupOptions) class allows you to specify options for document cleaning. To remove duplicate styles or just unused styles or lists from the document, you can use the [Cleanup](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#cleanup()) method. You can use the [UnusedStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedStyles) and [UnusedBuiltinStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedBuiltinStyles) properties to detect and remove styles that are marked as “unused”.

After converting DOCM to FODS, [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/) enables you to save your document to stream. If you need to save files to a Stream then you should create a FileOutputStream object and then [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.io.OutputStream,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) the file to that Stream object by calling the save method of [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object.

Converting **DOCM (Word Macro-Enabled Documents)** to **FODS (Flat ODF Spreadsheet XML)** is crucial for producing **open-standard, single-file spreadsheets** that are human-readable, diff-friendly, and version-controllable. Unlike binary formats, FODS stores spreadsheet data as plain XML, making it ideal for environments that demand **auditability, transparency, and long-term compliance**. This conversion enables teams to move structured data out of macro-enabled Word files and into a format optimized for **source control, governance, and cross-platform interoperability**.  


{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}  

- **Storing Spreadsheets in Git for Readable Diffs**  
  Keep tabular data in XML form where changes can be tracked line by line in version control systems.  

- **Enabling Transparent Audits with Human-Readable XML**  
  Provide auditors with clear, text-based access to spreadsheet logic and values.  

- **Exchanging Templates Across ODF-Compatible Tools**  
  Share data and templates seamlessly across LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and other ODF-compliant platforms.  

- **Localizing Spreadsheet Labels via XML Editing**  
  Translate or adapt spreadsheet headers and labels directly in the XML source.  

- **Preserving Macro-Free Compliance**  
  Ensure DOCM-derived data remains free from macros when stored in FODS format.  


{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col %}}
{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}  

- **DOCM-to-FODS CLI Pipelines**  
  Automate conversions through command-line tools for repeatable, scriptable workflows.  

- **Continuous Integration Jobs that Validate Schema and Run Tests on XML**  
  Incorporate FODS validation into CI/CD pipelines to enforce consistency and correctness.  

- **Watch-Folder Services that Convert and Commit to Git**  
  Monitor directories for DOCM files, convert them to FODS, and automatically commit to repositories.  

- **Policy Engines that Enforce Macro-Free Outputs**  
  Ensure compliance by blocking macro-enabled content and exporting only clean FODS files.  

- **Metadata Injectors that Tag FODS for Governance**  
  Enrich outputs with metadata (ownership, version, policy tags) for regulated environments.
