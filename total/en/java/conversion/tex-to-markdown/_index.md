Converting TEX to MARKDOWN is a simple two-step process that can be done using the powerful APIs from Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, edit, and convert documents.

The first step is to render the TEX file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to render TEX files to DOC.

The second step is to convert the DOC file to MARKDOWN using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to convert DOC files to MARKDOWN.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert TEX to MARKDOWN in just two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render the TEX file to DOC, and Aspose.Words for Java is used to convert the DOC file to MARKDOWN. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert TEX to MARKDOWN.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to MARKDOWN format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set MARKDOWN as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java

// save TEX as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.MARKDOWN
outputDocument.save("output.markdown", SaveFormat.MARKDOWN);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected TEX Document via Java" %}}
While converting TEX to MARKDOWN, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the TEX using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.tex", "password");
// save TEX as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MARKDOWN Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to MARKDOWN file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your MARKDOWN to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.MARKDOWN);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
