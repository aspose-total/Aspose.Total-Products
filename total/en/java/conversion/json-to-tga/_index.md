Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert JSON format to TGA within any Java application. This suite of APIs includes Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java, which can be used to parse JSON to JPEG and convert JPEG to TGA respectively.

Using Aspose.Cells for Java, developers can parse JSON to JPEG in a few simple steps. This API provides a wide range of features that allow developers to manipulate and convert spreadsheets in various formats. It also provides a powerful set of features to parse JSON to JPEG, such as the ability to read and write JSON files, convert JSON to Excel, and more.

Once the JSON is parsed to JPEG, Aspose.Imaging for Java can be used to convert JPEG to TGA. This API provides a wide range of features that allow developers to manipulate and convert images in various formats. It also provides a powerful set of features to convert JPEG to TGA, such as the ability to read and write TGA files, convert JPEG to TGA, and more.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert JSON format to TGA within any Java application in two simple steps. This suite of APIs provides a comprehensive set of features that allow developers to manipulate and convert spreadsheets and images in various formats.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as JPEG using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to TGA format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to TGA with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to TGA with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to TGA with watermark in your TGA document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert JSON to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as TGA format.
