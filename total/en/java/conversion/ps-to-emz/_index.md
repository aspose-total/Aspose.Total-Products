Converting a PostScript (PS) file to an Enhanced Metafile (EMZ) image in Java can be done in two simple steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the PS file to a JPEG image. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This package contains a suite of APIs for manipulating various file formats, including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. 

Once the PS file has been converted to a JPEG image, the second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to an EMZ image. Aspose.Imaging for Java is an image processing API that provides a wide range of features for manipulating images, including resizing, cropping, rotating, and more. It also supports a variety of image formats, including EMZ. 

By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert a PS file to an EMZ image in Java. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating various file formats. With these APIs, you can quickly and easily convert a PS file to an EMZ image in Java.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render PS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to EMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export PS file to EMZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PS document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to EMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to EMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS to EMZ With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export PS file to EMZ with watermark in your EMZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert PS to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as EMZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PS to EMZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output EMZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
