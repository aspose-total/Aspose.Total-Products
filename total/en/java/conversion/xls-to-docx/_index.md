Rendering XLS to DOCX is a two step process. You’ll first use [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) API to convert the given XLS document to PDF, and then by using [Aspose.Pdf for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java) API, you can easily convert your PDF document to DOCX. Both APIs come under the collection of [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) file format automation libraries.

2. Convert XLS to PDF and set SaveFormat to AUTO
3. Load the converted PDF file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
4. Save the document to DOCX format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method and set DocX as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include [Aspose.Cells](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Pdf](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/#installing-asposepdf-for-java-from-aspose-repository) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/java).
