Converting MHTML to OTT is a simple two-step process that can be done with the help of Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a powerful suite of APIs that can be used to manipulate documents and images. The first step in the process is to render the MHTML file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that can be used to render MHTML files to DOC. After the MHTML file is rendered to DOC, the second step is to use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to OTT. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that can be used to convert DOC files to OTT.

The process of converting MHTML to OTT is simple and straightforward. All you need to do is render the MHTML file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java and then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to OTT. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to manipulate documents and images. It includes both Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java, making it easy to convert MHTML to OTT.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MHTML to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to OTT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set OTT as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected MHTML Document via Java" %}}
While converting MHTML to OTT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the MHTML using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.mhtml", "password");
// save MHTML as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save OTT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to OTT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your OTT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.OTT);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
