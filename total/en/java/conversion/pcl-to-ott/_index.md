Converting PCL to OTT can be done quickly and easily with the help of Aspose.Total for Java. This package includes two powerful APIs, Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java, which can be used to render PCL files to DOC and then convert DOC to OTT respectively.

The first step is to render PCL file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to render PCL files to DOC. It also supports a variety of other formats, such as HTML, XPS, and SVG.

Once the PCL file is rendered to DOC, the next step is to convert DOC to OTT using Aspose.Words for Java. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to process documents, including the ability to convert DOC to OTT. It also supports a variety of other formats, such as PDF, HTML, and XPS.

Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive package that includes both Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java. This package provides a wide range of features to manipulate documents, including the ability to render PCL files to DOC and convert DOC to OTT. It also supports a variety of other formats, such as HTML, XPS, and SVG.

In summary, Aspose.Total for Java is the perfect solution for quickly and easily converting PCL to OTT. With the help of Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java, you can render PCL files to DOC and then convert DOC to OTT in just two simple steps.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PCL to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to OTT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set OTT as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.OTT

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected PCL Document via Java" %}}
While converting PCL to OTT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the PCL using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.pcl", "password");
// save PCL as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save OTT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to OTT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your OTT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.OTT);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
