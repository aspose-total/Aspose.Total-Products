Converting XPS to RTF is a simple two-step process that can be accomplished with the help of Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provide a wide range of features for document processing. The first step in the conversion process is to render the XPS file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides features for rendering XPS files to DOC. After the XPS file has been rendered to DOC, the second step is to convert the DOC file to RTF using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents in various formats. It also provides features for converting DOC files to RTF. With the help of Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert XPS to RTF in just two simple steps.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XPS to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to RTF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set RTF as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

// save XPS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.RTF
outputDocument.save("output.rtf", SaveFormat.RTF);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XPS Document via Java" %}}
While converting XPS to RTF, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the XPS using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.xps", "password");
// save XPS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save RTF Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to RTF file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your RTF to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.RTF);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
