Converting a PS file to DOTX can be done in two simple steps using Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a powerful suite of APIs that can be used to process documents. 

The first step is to render the PS file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that can be used to convert PDF documents to other formats. It can also be used to render PDF documents to DOC format. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to DOTX using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that can be used to convert documents from one format to another. It can be used to convert DOC files to DOTX format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert PS files to DOTX in two simple steps. First, you need to render the PS file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Then, you can use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC file to DOTX. This is a quick and easy way to convert PS files to DOTX.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOTX format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOTX as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected PS Document via Java" %}}
While converting PS to DOTX, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the PS using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.ps", "password");
// save PS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOTX Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOTX file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOTX to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.DOTX);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
