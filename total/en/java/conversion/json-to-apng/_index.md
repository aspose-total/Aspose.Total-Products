Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert JSON format to APNG within any Java application. This suite of APIs consists of Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java, which can be used to parse JSON to JPEG and convert JPEG to APNG respectively.

The conversion process is simple and straightforward. Firstly, Aspose.Cells for Java can be used to parse JSON to JPEG. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate spreadsheets, including the ability to read and write data from various file formats, such as JSON, XLSX, XLS, CSV, and ODS. It also provides a comprehensive set of features to work with charts, pivot tables, and shapes.

Once the JSON data is converted to JPEG, Aspose.Imaging for Java can be used to convert JPEG to APNG. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate images, including the ability to read and write data from various file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF. It also provides a comprehensive set of features to work with layers, frames, and animation.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert JSON format to APNG within any Java application in two simple steps. This suite of APIs provides a wide range of features to manipulate spreadsheets and images, making it an ideal choice for developers who need to convert JSON to APNG.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as JPEG using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to APNG format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to APNG with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to APNG with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to APNG with watermark in your APNG document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert JSON to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as APNG format.
