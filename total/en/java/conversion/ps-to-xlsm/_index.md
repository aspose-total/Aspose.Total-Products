Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert PostScript (PS) files to Microsoft Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (XLSM) files. This can be achieved in two steps.

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the PS file to an XLSX file. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents from within their Java applications. It can be used to render a PS file to an XLSX file with just a few lines of code.

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to an XLSM file. Aspose.Cells for Java is a Spreadsheet Programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets from within their Java applications. It can be used to convert an XLSX file to an XLSM file with just a few lines of code.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate the ability to convert PS to XLSM files into their Java applications. The two-step process of using Aspose.PDF for Java to render the PS file to an XLSX file and then using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to an XLSM file is simple and straightforward. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily add this feature to their applications.

If your PS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS File to XLSM with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting PS file to XLSM, you can also add watermark to your output XLSM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLSM with Watermark.
