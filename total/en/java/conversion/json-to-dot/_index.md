By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can convert JSON to DOT in your Java applications in two-step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/) you can parse JSON to PDF. In the second step, you can convert PDF to DOT by using Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/).

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to DOT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON while parsing JSON to DOT using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to DOT with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to DOT with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your DOT document, you can first convert the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to DOT.
