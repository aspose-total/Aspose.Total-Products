Converting a PostScript (PS) file to an IMAGE image in Java is a straightforward process that can be accomplished in two simple steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export a PS file to a JPEG image. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG image to an IMAGE image. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to export a PS file to a JPEG image. The API also supports a range of other features, such as the ability to extract text, images, and other content from PDF documents, as well as the ability to create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents. 

Aspose.Imaging for Java is a powerful image processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and manipulate images. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to render a JPEG image to an IMAGE image. The API also supports a range of other features, such as the ability to convert images between different formats, as well as the ability to apply various image processing operations, such as resizing, cropping, and rotating. 

By combining the power of Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java, developers can easily convert a PS file to an IMAGE image in Java. The process is simple and straightforward, and can be accomplished in just two steps.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render PS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export PS file to IMAGE to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PS document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to IMAGE. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS to IMAGE With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export PS file to IMAGE with watermark in your IMAGE document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert PS to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PS to IMAGE File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output IMAGE image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
