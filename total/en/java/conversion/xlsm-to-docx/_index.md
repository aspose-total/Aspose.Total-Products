Rendering XLSM to DOCX is a two step process. You’ll first use [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) API to convert the given XLSM document to PDF, and then by using [Aspose.Pdf for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java) API, you can easily convert your PDF document to DOCX. Both APIs come under the collection of [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) file format automation libraries.

2. Convert XLSM to PDF and set SaveFormat to AUTO
3. Load the converted PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
