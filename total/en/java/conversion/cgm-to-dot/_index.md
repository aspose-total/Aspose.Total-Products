1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOT as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to DOT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the ownerâ€™s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement.

Converting **Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)** files to **DOT (Microsoft Word Template)** format is essential for organizations aiming to standardize technical and engineering documentation. In **Java-based document processing systems**, this conversion enables the creation of reusable templates that include CGM-based diagrams, ensuring consistent formatting across reports, manuals, and engineering documents. By embedding CGM visuals into DOT templates, enterprises can streamline content creation, maintain branding standards, and improve the efficiency of document generation workflows.


{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}

- **Reusable Technical Drawing Templates**  
  Store CGM diagrams within DOT files for quick reuse in multiple technical reports or manuals.

- **Engineering Document Standardization**  
  Ensure all engineering-related documents follow a consistent structure and visual presentation.

- **Consistent Report Formatting**  
  Apply uniform styles, layouts, and headers while integrating CGM illustrations into professional reports.
