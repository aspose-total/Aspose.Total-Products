You can convert POWERPOINT file to TSV via [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) in two step steps. In the first step you can export POWERPOINT to HTML by using [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/). Secondly, by using [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/), you can convert HTML to TSV.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input POWERPOINT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TSV without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.

While converting POWERPOINT file to TSV, you can also add watermark to your output TSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted HTML file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your HTML document as TSV with Watermark.
