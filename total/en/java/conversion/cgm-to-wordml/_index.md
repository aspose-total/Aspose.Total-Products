Converting CGM to WORDML can be done in two simple steps using Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provide powerful document processing capabilities. 

The first step is to render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render CGM files to DOC. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to WORDML using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert Word documents. It also provides the ability to convert DOC files to WORDML. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert CGM to WORDML in two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render the CGM file to DOC, and Aspose.Words for Java is used to convert the DOC file to WORDML. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert CGM to WORDML.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to WORDML, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the ownerâ€™s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save WORDML Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to WORDML file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your WORDML to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement.
