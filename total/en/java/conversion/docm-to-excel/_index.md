Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input DOCM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to EXCEL without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:
