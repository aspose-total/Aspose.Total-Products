Converting a PS file to SVGZ image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the PS file to JPEG. Aspose.PDF for Java is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which is a suite of APIs that provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating and converting various file formats. 

Once the PS file has been converted to JPEG, the second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG to SVGZ. Aspose.Imaging for Java is an image processing API that provides a wide range of features for manipulating and converting images. It supports a variety of image formats, including SVGZ, and can be used to convert JPEG to SVGZ. 

By following these two simple steps, you can easily convert a PS file to SVGZ image in Java. Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java are both part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which makes it easy to access the APIs and get started with the conversion process. With the help of these APIs, you can quickly and easily convert PS files to SVGZ images in Java.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render PS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export PS file to SVGZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PS document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to SVGZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS to SVGZ With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export PS file to SVGZ with watermark in your SVGZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert PS to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as SVGZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PS to SVGZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output SVGZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
