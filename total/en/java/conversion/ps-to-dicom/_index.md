Converting a PostScript (PS) file to a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image in Java can be done in two simple steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export the PS file to a JPEG image. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API, which is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API provides image processing capabilities and can be used to render the JPEG image to a DICOM image. 

The Aspose.PDF for Java API is a powerful tool for creating, editing, and converting PDF documents. It can be used to convert PS files to JPEG images with just a few lines of code. It also supports a wide range of other file formats, including Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, HTML, and more. 

The Aspose.Imaging for Java API is a comprehensive image processing library that provides a wide range of features for manipulating images. It can be used to render JPEG images to DICOM images with just a few lines of code. It also supports a wide range of other image formats, including TIFF, GIF, BMP, PNG, and more. 

By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert a PS file to a DICOM image in Java. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with a wide range of file formats. With just a few lines of code, you can quickly and easily convert PS files to DICOM images in Java.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render PS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to DICOM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS to DICOM in a Single File via Java" %}}
The API also allows you to export PS file to DICOM to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PS document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to DICOM. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to DICOM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS to DICOM With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export PS file to DICOM with watermark in your DICOM document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert PS to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as DICOM format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PS to DICOM File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output DICOM image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
