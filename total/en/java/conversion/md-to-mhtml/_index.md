Converting a Markdown (MD) file to MHTML is a simple two-step process. The first step is to render the MD file to a DOC file using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This package contains a wide range of APIs for working with different file formats, including PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Once the MD file has been rendered to a DOC file, the second step is to use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC file to MHTML. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables you to easily convert between different file formats. It also provides a range of features for working with documents, such as document manipulation, document comparison, and document conversion.

By using Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java, you can quickly and easily convert an MD file to MHTML. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with different file formats. With these APIs, you can easily convert MD files to MHTML in just two simple steps.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MD to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to MHTML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set MHTML as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.MHTML
outputDocument.save("output.mhtml", SaveFormat.MHTML);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected MD Document via Java" %}}
While converting MD to MHTML, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the MD using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.md", "password");
// save MD as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MHTML Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to MHTML file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your MHTML to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.MHTML);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
