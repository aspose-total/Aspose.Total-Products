Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features it provides is the ability to convert Markdown (MD) files to Excel Template (XLTMs). This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the MD file to an Excel Spreadsheet (XLSX). Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents in Java applications. It also provides the ability to render MD files to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert MD files to XLSX. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to an XLTM file. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and manipulate spreadsheets in Java applications. It also provides the ability to convert XLSX files to XLTM files, allowing developers to easily convert XLSX files to XLTM files. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate MD to XLTM conversion feature into their Java applications. It provides the ability to render MD files to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for Java, and then convert XLSX to XLTM using Aspose.Cells for Java. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert MD files to XLTM files in their Java applications.

If your MD document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting MD file to XLTM, you can also add watermark to your output XLTM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLTM with Watermark.
