Converting a CGM file to a WMF image in Java can be done in two easy steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export CGM files to JPEG images. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG image to a WMF image. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents. It supports a wide range of file formats, including CGM, and can be used to export CGM files to JPEG images. The API also provides a range of features such as text extraction, document signing, and PDF/A conversion. 

Aspose.Imaging for Java is an image processing API that enables developers to manipulate images in a variety of ways. It supports a wide range of image formats, including WMF, and can be used to render JPEG images to WMF images. The API also provides a range of features such as image resizing, cropping, and color conversion. 

By combining the two APIs, developers can easily convert CGM files to WMF images in Java. The Aspose.Total for Java package provides both APIs in one package, making it easy to access both APIs and use them together. With the help of these APIs, developers can quickly and easily convert CGM files to WMF images in Java.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render CGM to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to WMF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export CGM file to WMF to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your CGM document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to WMF. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to WMF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert CGM to WMF With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export CGM file to WMF with watermark in your WMF document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert CGM to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as WMF format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate CGM to WMF File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output WMF image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
