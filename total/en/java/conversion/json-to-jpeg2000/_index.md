1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as JPEG using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to JPEG2000 with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to JPEG2000 with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to JPEG2000 with watermark in your JPEG2000 document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert JSON to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.
