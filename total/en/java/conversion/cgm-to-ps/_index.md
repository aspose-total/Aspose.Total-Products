Converting CGM to PS is a simple two-step process. First, you need to render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF document processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. Once the CGM file is rendered to DOC, you can use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to PS. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. 

The process of converting CGM to PS is straightforward and easy to use. All you need to do is render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java and then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to PS. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, so you don't need to worry about downloading and installing any additional software. 

With Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert CGM to PS in just two simple steps. All you need to do is render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java and then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to PS. This process is fast, easy, and reliable, making it the perfect solution for anyone looking to convert CGM to PS.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to PS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set PS as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to PS, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.cgm", "password");
// save CGM as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PS Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to PS file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your PS to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.PS);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}

Converting CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) to PS (PostScript) is a critical step in achieving precise, high-quality printing and professional publishing results. PostScript’s device-independent format ensures that complex vector graphics, engineering diagrams, and technical illustrations retain their accuracy and fidelity when transferred to print presses or publishing systems. This makes CGM to PS conversion indispensable for industries requiring consistent, scalable, and print-ready outputs.

## ✅ Key Use Cases
- **Industrial-Grade Vector Printing** – Produce sharp, scalable technical diagrams for manufacturing, engineering, and architectural documentation.
- **Archiving Technical Illustrations in PostScript-Based Systems** – Store vector assets in a format optimized for long-term accessibility and print compatibility.
- **Preparing CGM Diagrams for Typesetting** – Ensure seamless integration into professional page layout and typesetting workflows.
- **Physical Document Production** – Generate print-ready files for manuals, catalogs, and large-format technical charts.

## ⚙️ Automation Scenarios
- **Java-Based Print Stream Generators** – Programmatically convert CGM files into high-resolution PS output for enterprise print workflows.
- **Vector-to-PostScript Batch Converters** – Automate large-scale conversion processes to handle extensive graphics archives efficiently.
- **Publishing Pipeline Integration** – Embed CGM to PS conversion into automated document rendering and professional publishing systems for consistent, high-quality results.
