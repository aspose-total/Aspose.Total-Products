Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert CGM to POTM within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of APIs is designed to provide developers with the tools they need to quickly and efficiently convert CGM to POTM.

The process of converting CGM to POTM begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is a powerful PDF Processing API. This API allows developers to export CGM to PPTX, which is a PowerPoint presentation format. Once the CGM has been exported to PPTX, developers can then use Aspose.Slides for Java, which is a PowerPoint Processing API, to convert the PPTX to POTM.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Format APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java
// load CGM file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.cgm");
// save CGM as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Potm format
presentation.save("output.potm", SaveFormat.Potm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted CGM File via Java" %}}
While loading CGM file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open CGM document
Document doc = new Document("input.cgm", "Your@Password");
// save CGM as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save POTM File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting CGM to POTM, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Potm format
presentation.save("output.potm", SaveFormat.Potm);
