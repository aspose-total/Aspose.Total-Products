<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert JSON to Word formats?</h2>

Converting JSON files to Word formats can be advantageous in certain circumstances. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is commonly used for data storage and exchange in web applications. Word, on the other hand, is a file format that is designed primarily for creating and sharing text documents. Firstly, Word is a more accessible format for individuals who are not familiar with JSON. JSON is a machine-readable format, which can make it difficult for non-technical users to work with. Converting JSON to Word can enable users to access and work with data in a more user-friendly format. Secondly, Word offers more advanced formatting and layout capabilities compared to JSON. Word enables users to add images, tables, graphs, and other visual elements to documents, which can be useful when presenting data or creating reports. Thirdly, converting JSON to Word can enable users to customize and edit data according to their specific needs. Word documents can be easily edited, formatted, and saved in various formats, which can simplify the process of creating and sharing data reports.

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON while parsing JSON to Word using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.
