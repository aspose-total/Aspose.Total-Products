Converting a DOCM file to PPTX programmatically can be a daunting task for developers. Fortunately, the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) provide a simple and efficient way to automate the process. 

The first step is to load the DOCM file using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). This library provides a wide range of features for manipulating DOCM files, such as converting them to HTML. Once the file is loaded, the HTML content can be written to a new Presentation using [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/). This powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API allows developers to create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPTX. 

The File Automation Java libraries provide a comprehensive set of features for automating the conversion of DOCM files to PPTX. With just a few simple steps, developers can easily convert their DOCM files to PPTX and save time and effort.

Using the API, you can also perform DOCM file to PPTX conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPTX document, you can first export DOCM to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPTX.
