Rendering XLSX to DOC is a two step process. Youâ€™ll first use [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) API to convert the given XLSX document to PDF, and then by using [Aspose.Pdf for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java) API, you can easily convert your PDF document to DOC. Both APIs come under the collection of [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) file format automation libraries.

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include [Aspose.Cells](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Pdf](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/#installing-asposepdf-for-java-from-aspose-repository) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/java).
