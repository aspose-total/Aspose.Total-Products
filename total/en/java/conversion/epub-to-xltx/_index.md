Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate EPUB to XLTX conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process involves the use of Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java. 

The first step involves rendering EPUB to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for Java. This component is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, convert, and print PDF documents without any external dependencies. It also provides the ability to render EPUB to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert EPUB documents to XLSX format. 

The second step involves converting XLSX to XLTX using Aspose.Cells for Java. This Spreadsheet Programming API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with Excel spreadsheets. It enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert spreadsheets in various formats, including XLSX, XLTX, XLS, CSV, and HTML. It also provides the ability to convert XLSX to XLTX, allowing developers to easily convert XLSX documents to XLTX format. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for Java provides an easy and efficient way to integrate EPUB to XLTX conversion feature into Java applications. By using Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, developers can easily render EPUB to XLSX and convert XLSX to XLTX, respectively. This allows developers to quickly and easily convert EPUB documents to XLTX format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected EPUB to XLTX via Java" %}}
If your EPUB document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTX without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB File to XLTX with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB file to XLTX, you can also add watermark to your output XLTX file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLTX with Watermark.
