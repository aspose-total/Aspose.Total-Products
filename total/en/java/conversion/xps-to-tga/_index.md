Converting an XPS file to a TGA image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the XPS file to a JPEG image. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to easily convert XPS files to JPEG images with just a few lines of code. 

The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to a TGA image. Aspose.Imaging for Java is an advanced image processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API provides a wide range of image manipulation capabilities, including the ability to render JPEG images to TGA images. With just a few lines of code, you can easily convert your XPS file to a TGA image. 

Overall, converting an XPS file to a TGA image in Java is a straightforward process that can be completed in just two steps. By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert your XPS file to a TGA image with just a few lines of code. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating PDF and image files.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render XPS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to TGA format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert XPS to TGA in a Single File via Java" %}}
The API also allows you to export XPS file to TGA to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your XPS document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to TGA. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to TGA format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert XPS to TGA With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export XPS file to TGA with watermark in your TGA document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert XPS to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as TGA format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate XPS to TGA File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output TGA image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
