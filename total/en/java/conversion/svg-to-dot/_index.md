You can convert SVG to DOT by using two simple steps. First you need to render SVG file to DOC using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/). After that, by using powerful Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/), you can convert DOC to DOT. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) package.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOT format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOT as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/java).

```java
// load SVG file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.svg");
// save SVG as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.DOT
outputDocument.save("output.dot", SaveFormat.DOT);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected SVG Document via Java" %}}
While converting SVG to DOT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the SVG using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.svg", "password");
// save SVG as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.DOT);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}  
```
