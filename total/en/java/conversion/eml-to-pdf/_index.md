[Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) offers a powerful feature for Java developers to integrate email conversion within any Java application. With the package, you can easily convert Email EML to PDF without the need for any third-party dependencies. The process is a two-step conversion using two APIs included in the package. The first step involves using the Email Manipulation API, [Aspose.Email for Java](https://products.aspose.com/email/java/), to convert the EML file format to HTML. This API provides a rich set of features that allow you to work with emails and attachments, as well as convert email formats to other formats such as PDF, HTML, and MSG. The second step is to render the HTML to PDF using the Document Processing API, [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). This API is designed for working with Word documents and offers a wide range of features for creating, manipulating, and converting Word documents to various formats. <br><br>

By using these two APIs, you can easily convert Email EML to PDF within any Java J2SE, J2EE, J2ME application, making it a valuable tool for developers working with email conversion.
