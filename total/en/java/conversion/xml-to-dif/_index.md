Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to integrate XML to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications. It provides a two-step process to achieve this goal. 

The first step involves using Aspose.PDF for Java to render XML to XLSX. This component is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their Java applications. It supports a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, document assembly, and much more. 

The second step involves using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to DIF. This Spreadsheet Programming API enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets from within their Java applications. It supports a wide range of features such as data import/export, formula calculation engine, charting, and much more. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate XML to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications. It provides a two-step process to achieve this goal. Firstly, by using Aspose.PDF for Java, developers can render XML to XLSX. In the second step, they can convert XLSX to DIF by using Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java. This makes it easy for developers to integrate this feature in their applications without having to write complex code.

If your XML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting XML file to DIF, you can also add watermark to your output DIF file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as DIF with Watermark.
