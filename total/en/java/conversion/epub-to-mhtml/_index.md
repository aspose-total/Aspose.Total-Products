Converting EPUB to MHTML is a simple two-step process that can be done using the powerful Document Processing API Aspose.Words for Java. This API is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which includes a range of APIs for working with documents.

The first step is to render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. This API provides a range of features for working with PDF documents, including the ability to render EPUB files to DOC. Once the EPUB file has been rendered to DOC, the second step is to use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to MHTML.

Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful Document Processing API that provides a range of features for working with documents. It can be used to convert DOC to MHTML, as well as a range of other document formats. It also provides features for working with text, images, tables, and more.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert EPUB to MHTML in two simple steps. First, render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java, and then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to MHTML. This powerful Document Processing API provides a range of features for working with documents, making it easy to convert EPUB to MHTML.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to MHTML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set MHTML as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected EPUB Document via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB to MHTML, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the EPUB using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.epub", "password");
// save EPUB as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MHTML Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to MHTML file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your MHTML to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.MHTML);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
