Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert SVG to XLTM. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the SVG to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents in Java applications. It also provides the ability to render SVG to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert SVG to XLSX in their Java applications. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX to XLTM. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in Java applications. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to convert XLSX to XLTM. This allows developers to easily convert XLSX to XLTM in their Java applications. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate the ability to convert SVG to XLTM into their Java applications. The two-step process involves using Aspose.PDF for Java to render the SVG to XLSX, and then using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX to XLTM. This allows developers to quickly and easily convert SVG to XLTM in their Java applications.

If your SVG document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert SVG File to XLTM with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting SVG file to XLTM, you can also add watermark to your output XLTM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLTM with Watermark.
