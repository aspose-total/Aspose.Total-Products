<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert XML files to CSV via Java?</h2>

Converting XML to CSV can be useful for a number of reasons. One reason is that CSV files are more compact than XML files, which makes them easier to handle and process. CSV files are also easier to import into a variety of software applications, including databases, spreadsheets, and other data analysis tools. Another reason why someone might want to convert XML to CSV is that CSV files are more human-readable than XML files. XML files can be difficult to read and understand, especially if they contain complex nested structures. CSV files, on the other hand, are easy to read and understand, even for non-technical users.
