Fortunately, this process can be automated with the help of the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/).

The first step is to load the ODT file using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). This library allows you to convert the ODT file into HTML. After that, you can use the powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) to create a new Presentation. This library allows you to write HTML content into the Presentation and save it as a PPT file.
