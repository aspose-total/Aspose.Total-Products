Often times developers have to convert DOC file to PPSM programmatically. By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can automate the rendering process in a few simple steps. You can load your DOC file by using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) and convert it to HTML. After that by using powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPSM.

For DOC to PPSM file conversion, you can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to convert password-protected DOC documents to PPSM. If your input DOC document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPSM format without using the password. In order to open a encrypted document you can set the correct password in LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.

Using the API, you can also perform DOC file to PPSM conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPSM document, you can first export DOC to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPSM.
