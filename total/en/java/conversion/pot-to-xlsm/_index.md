Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input POT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSM without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.

While converting POT file to XLSM, you can also add watermark to your output XLSM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted HTML file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your HTML document as XLSM with Watermark.
