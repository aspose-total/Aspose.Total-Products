{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Remove Unused Information from a OTT Document via Java" %}}
Before converting OTT to EXCEL, you can remove unused information from OTT Document via [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). Sometimes you may need to remove unused or duplicate information to reduce the size of the output document and processing time. The [CleanupOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/CleanupOptions) class allows you to specify options for document cleaning. To remove duplicate styles or just unused styles or lists from the document, you can use the [Cleanup](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#cleanup()) method. You can use the [UnusedStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedStyles) and [UnusedBuiltinStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedBuiltinStyles) properties to detect and remove styles that are marked as “unused”.

After converting OTT to EXCEL, [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/) enables you to save your document to stream. If you need to save files to a Stream then you should create a FileOutputStream object and then [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.io.OutputStream,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) the file to that Stream object by calling the save method of [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object.
