1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted SVG File via Java" %}}
While loading SVG file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open SVG document
Document doc = new Document("input.svg", "Your@Password");
// save SVG as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save POTM File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting SVG to POTM, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Potm format
presentation.save("output.potm", SaveFormat.Potm);
