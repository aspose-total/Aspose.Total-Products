Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to integrate CGM to TSV conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which are two powerful APIs that can be used to render CGM to XLSX and convert XLSX to TSV respectively. 

The process of converting CGM to TSV involves two steps. In the first step, Aspose.PDF for Java can be used to render CGM to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to manipulate PDF documents in their Java applications. It supports a variety of formats, including CGM, and provides a comprehensive set of features to render CGM to XLSX. 

In the second step, Aspose.Cells for Java can be used to convert XLSX to TSV. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to manipulate spreadsheets in Java applications. It supports a variety of formats, including XLSX, and provides a comprehensive set of features to convert XLSX to TSV. It also provides a wide range of features to manipulate the data in the TSV file, such as sorting, filtering, and formatting. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for Java is an ideal solution for developers who need to integrate CGM to TSV conversion feature in their Java applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features to render CGM to XLSX and convert XLSX to TSV. It also provides a wide range of features to manipulate the data in the TSV file. As a result, developers can easily integrate CGM to TSV conversion feature in their Java applications.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to TSV format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your CGM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TSV without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting CGM file to TSV, you can also add watermark to your output TSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as TSV with Watermark.

Transforming CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) files into TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format using Java utilities ensures precise column alignment and Unix-friendly data handling. This is particularly valuable in engineering workflows where simulation outputs and measurement datasets need to be processed in cross-platform environments. Java I/O APIs and TSV libraries enable robust and scalable CGM-to-TSV conversion pipelines that fit seamlessly into ETL processes.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}
- Creating column-aligned tables from CGM-based measurement data.
- Exporting simulation results into TSV for research and analysis.
- Ensuring compatibility with Unix/Linux command-line processing tools.
- Supporting data exchange in open-source engineering applications.
