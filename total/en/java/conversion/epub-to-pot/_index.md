Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert EPUB to POT within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of APIs provides a powerful set of tools to help developers quickly and easily create, edit, and manipulate documents in various formats. 

The first step in the process of converting EPUB to POT is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to export EPUB to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to help developers create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents. It also provides the ability to export documents to other formats, such as PPTX. 

Once the EPUB document has been exported to PPTX, the next step is to use Aspose.Slides for Java PowerPoint Processing API to convert PPTX to POT. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to help developers create, edit, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations. It also provides the ability to convert documents to other formats, such as POT.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted EPUB File via Java" %}}
While loading EPUB file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("input.epub", "Your@Password");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save POT File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting EPUB to POT, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Pot format
presentation.save("output.pot", SaveFormat.Pot);
