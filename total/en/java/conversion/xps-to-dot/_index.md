Converting XPS to DOT is a simple two-step process that can be accomplished using the powerful APIs from Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is the first step in the process, allowing you to render XPS files to DOC. Once the XPS file is converted to DOC, Aspose.Words for Java can be used to convert the DOC to DOT. 

Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, edit, and manipulate documents in a variety of formats. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that allows developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render XPS files to DOC. 

Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that allows developers to create, edit, and convert documents in a variety of formats. It provides the ability to convert DOC files to DOT, making it the perfect companion to Aspose.PDF for Java. 

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert XPS to DOT in just two simple steps. First, Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render XPS files to DOC. Then, Aspose.Words for Java is used to convert the DOC to DOT. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert XPS to DOT.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XPS to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOT as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

// save XPS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.DOT
outputDocument.save("output.dot", SaveFormat.DOT);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XPS Document via Java" %}}
While converting XPS to DOT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the XPS using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.xps", "password");
// save XPS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.DOT);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
