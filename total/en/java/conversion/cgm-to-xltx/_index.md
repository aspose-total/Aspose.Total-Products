Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate CGM to XLTX conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite consists of two APIs, Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which can be used in a two-step process to achieve the desired result.

The first step involves using Aspose.PDF for Java to render CGM to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents in Java applications. It also supports the conversion of CGM to XLSX format, which can be used as an intermediate format for further processing.

The second step involves using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to XLTX. This Spreadsheet Programming API provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in Java applications. It also supports the conversion of XLSX to XLTX format, which is the desired output format.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate CGM to XLTX conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite of APIs provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents and spreadsheets in Java applications. It also supports the conversion of CGM to XLTX format, which can be achieved in a two-step process.

If your CGM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTX without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert CGM File to XLTX with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting CGM file to XLTX, you can also add watermark to your output XLTX file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLTX with Watermark.
