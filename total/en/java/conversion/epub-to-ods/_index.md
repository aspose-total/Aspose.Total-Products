Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert EPUB files to ODS files. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the EPUB file to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents in Java applications. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to render EPUB files to XLSX. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to ODS. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and manipulate spreadsheets in Java applications. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to convert XLSX files to ODS. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate the ability to convert EPUB files to ODS files into their Java applications. The two-step process involves using Aspose.PDF for Java to render the EPUB file to XLSX, and then using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to ODS. This makes it easy for developers to add this feature to their applications without having to write any additional code.

If your EPUB document is password protected, you cannot convert it to ODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB File to ODS with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB file to ODS, you can also add watermark to your output ODS file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as ODS with Watermark.
