<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert Word files to JSON format?</h2>

There are several reasons why someone may want to convert Word files to JSON format. One common reason is to make the content of the Word document machine-readable, so that it can be easily parsed and analyzed by software applications. JSON is a lightweight, easy-to-read data format that is commonly used for data exchange between web applications, making it a useful format for data storage and transfer. Another reason is to enable the extraction of specific data from the Word document, such as text, images, or tables, and incorporate it into other applications or systems. Additionally, converting Word files to JSON can facilitate the automation of various document processing tasks, such as data extraction, document conversion, and data analysis.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total for Java can help in Word to JSON Conversion?</h2>

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input Word document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

While you are converting Word to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
