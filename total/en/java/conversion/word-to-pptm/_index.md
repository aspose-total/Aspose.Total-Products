Often times developers have to convert WORD file to PPTM programmatically. By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can automate the rendering process in a few simple steps. You can load your WORD file by using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) and convert it to HTML. After that by using powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPTM.

The API also allows you to convert password-protected WORD documents to PPTM. If your input WORD document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPTM format without using the password. In order to open a encrypted document you can set the correct password in LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.

Using the API, you can also perform WORD file to PPTM conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPTM document, you can first export WORD to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPTM.
