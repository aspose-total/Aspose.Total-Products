Converting DOTM files to PPTX programmatically can be a daunting task for developers. Fortunately, the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) provide an easy and efficient way to automate the process. The process involves loading the DOTM file using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/), converting it to HTML, and then using [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) to create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPTX. 

The first step is to load the DOTM file using Aspose.Words for Java. This library provides a wide range of features to manipulate Word documents, including the ability to load and save documents in various formats. Once the DOTM file is loaded, it can be converted to HTML using the Document.save method. This method allows you to specify the output format, such as HTML, and the output file name. 

The next step is to use Aspose.Slides for Java to create a new Presentation and write the HTML content in it. This library provides a comprehensive set of features to manipulate PowerPoint presentations, including the ability to create new presentations, add slides, and write HTML content. Once the HTML content is written, the Presentation can be saved as a PPTX file using the Presentation.save method. 

By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/), developers can easily and quickly convert DOTM files to PPTX programmatically. The process involves loading the DOTM file using Aspose.Words for Java, converting it to HTML, and then using Aspose.Slides for Java to create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPTX. This process is simple and efficient, and can be used to quickly and easily convert DOTM files to PPTX.

The API also allows you to convert password-protected DOTM documents to PPTX. If your input DOTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPTX format without using the password. In order to open a encrypted document you can set the correct password in LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.
