Converting an epub file to a PSD image in Java is a straightforward process that can be completed in two simple steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export the EPUB file to a JPEG image. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG image to a PSD image. 

The Aspose.PDF for Java API is a powerful library that enables you to manipulate PDF documents in Java. It allows you to convert PDF documents to a variety of image formats, including JPEG. It also provides a range of features for editing PDF documents, such as adding text, images, and annotations. 

The Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API is a comprehensive library that enables you to manipulate images in Java. It provides a range of features for editing images, such as resizing, cropping, and rotating. It also allows you to convert images from one format to another, including from JPEG to PSD. 

By combining the features of the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert an epub file to a PSD image in Java. The process is simple and straightforward, and can be completed in just two steps. With the Aspose.Total for Java package, you can access both APIs and take advantage of their powerful features to manipulate PDF documents and images in Java.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to PSD format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export EPUB file to PSD to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to PSD. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to PSD format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to PSD With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export EPUB file to PSD with watermark in your PSD document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert EPUB to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as PSD format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate EPUB to PSD File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output PSD image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
