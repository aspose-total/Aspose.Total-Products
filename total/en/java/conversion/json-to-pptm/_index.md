Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to PPTM with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPTM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPTM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPTM.
