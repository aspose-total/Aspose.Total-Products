[Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) File Format Automation libraries empower Java developers to automate the batch conversion process of PowerPoint PPT to Word DOTX. Converting the document is a two-step process and involves using two APIs. Weâ€™ll use [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) that is a PowerPoint API for presentations manipulation and management to convert PPT to HTML. After that by using feature-rich Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) we will convert the HTML to DOTX.

The API also allows you to perform PPT to DOTX conversion of password protected documents. If your input PPT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DOTX format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.
