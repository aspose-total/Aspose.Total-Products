Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert XML to XAML within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. The process involves two steps, both of which are made simple by the use of Aspose components. 

The first step is to export XML to PPTX using Aspose.PDF for Java. This component provides a wide range of features for working with PDF documents, including the ability to convert XML to PDF. Once the XML has been converted to PDF, it can then be exported to PPTX. 

The second step is to convert PPTX to XAML using Aspose.Slides for Java. This component provides a powerful PowerPoint Processing API that enables developers to quickly and easily convert PPTX to XAML. The API also provides a range of features for working with PowerPoint presentations, including the ability to add, edit, and delete slides, as well as to insert images, shapes, and text. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert XML to XAML within any Java application. The process is simple and straightforward, and the components provide a range of features for working with PDF and PowerPoint documents.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Format APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java

// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Xaml format
presentation.save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted XML File via Java" %}}
While loading XML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml", "Your@Password");
// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XAML File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting XML to XAML, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Xaml format
presentation.save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);
