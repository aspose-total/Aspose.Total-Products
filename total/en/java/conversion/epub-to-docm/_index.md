Converting EPUB to DOCM is a simple two-step process. First, you need to render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. Once the EPUB file is converted to DOC, you can use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC file to DOCM. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. 

The process of converting EPUB to DOCM is straightforward and easy to do. All you need to do is render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java and then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC file to DOCM. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, so you don’t need to purchase any additional software or services. With just a few clicks, you can quickly and easily convert EPUB to DOCM.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOCM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOCM as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected EPUB Document via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB to DOCM, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the EPUB using the owner’s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOCM Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOCM file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOCM to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.DOCM);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
