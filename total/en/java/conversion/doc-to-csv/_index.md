 Converting DOC to CSV via [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) is a simple two step process. By using feature-rich, document manipulation and conversion API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/), you can export DOC to HTML. After that, by using [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/), you can convert HTML to CSV.

1. Open DOC file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class
2. Convert DOC to HTML by using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load HTML document by using [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to CSV format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Remove Unused Information from a DOC Document via Java" %}}
Before converting DOC to CSV, you can remove unused information from DOC Document via [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). Sometimes you may need to remove unused or duplicate information to reduce the size of the output document and processing time. The [CleanupOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/CleanupOptions) class allows you to specify options for document cleaning. To remove duplicate styles or just unused styles or lists from the document, you can use the [Cleanup](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#cleanup()) method. You can use the [UnusedStyles](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedStyles) and [UnusedBuiltinStyles](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedBuiltinStyles) properties to detect and remove styles that are marked as “unused”.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save CSV File to Stream via Java" %}}
After converting DOC to CSV, [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/) enables you to save your document to stream. If you need to save files to a Stream then you should create a FileOutputStream object and then [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.io.OutputStream,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) the file to that Stream object by calling the save method of [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object.
