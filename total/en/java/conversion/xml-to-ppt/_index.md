<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert XML to PowerPoint PPT Format via Java?</h2>

Converting XML to PowerPoint PPT format via Java is essential for transforming structured data into a visually engaging presentation format. This conversion facilitates data visualization, enhances content sharing, and streamlines the creation of professional presentations, making it valuable for data-driven and information-sharing Java applications.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in XML to PPT Conversion?</h2>

With [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/), converting XML to PPT within any Java application is straightforward. This process involves two steps: initially, use Aspose.PDF for Java to export XML to PPTX. Subsequently, employ Aspose.Slides for Java, the PowerPoint Processing API, to convert the PPTX to PPT. This approach simplifies the entire conversion process.

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/installation/) in your pom.xml. Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java)

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Load Encrypted XML via Java" %}}
While loading XML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml", "Your@Password");
// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PPT with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting XML to PPT, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Ppt format
presentation.save("output.ppt", SaveFormat.Ppt);
