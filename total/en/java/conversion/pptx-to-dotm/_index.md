Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enable Java developers to automate the batch conversion process of PowerPoint PPTX to Word DOTM. This two-step process involves using two APIs, Aspose.Slides for Java and Aspose.Words for Java. 

Aspose.Slides for Java is a powerful PowerPoint API for presentations manipulation and management. It allows developers to convert PPTX to HTML, which is then used as an intermediate format for the conversion process. The HTML file is then converted to DOTM by Aspose.Words for Java, a feature-rich Word Processing API. 

The conversion process is simple and straightforward. All that is required is to upload the PPTX file to the Aspose.Slides for Java API, and the HTML file is generated. This HTML file is then uploaded to the Aspose.Words for Java API, and the DOTM file is generated. The entire process is automated, and the output is of the highest quality.
