{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected XSLFO to MD via Java" %}}
If your XSLFO document is password protected, you cannot convert it to MD without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.
