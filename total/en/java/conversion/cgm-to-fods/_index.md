Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate CGM to FODS conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite of APIs provides a two-step process for converting CGM to FODS. 

The first step involves using Aspose.PDF for Java to render CGM to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents in Java applications. It provides a wide range of features such as creating PDF documents from scratch, converting PDF documents to other formats, adding or removing text, images, annotations, and other elements from PDF documents, and much more. 

The second step involves using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to FODS. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and manipulate spreadsheets in Java applications. It provides a wide range of features such as creating spreadsheets from scratch, converting spreadsheets to other formats, adding or removing worksheets, rows, columns, and other elements from spreadsheets, and much more. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate CGM to FODS conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite of APIs provides a two-step process for converting CGM to FODS, which makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily add this feature to their applications.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to FODS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your CGM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to FODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting CGM file to FODS, you can also add watermark to your output FODS file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as FODS with Watermark.

Converting **Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)** files to **FODS (Flat OpenDocument Spreadsheet)** format is an effective way to transform graphical technical data into structured, open-standard spreadsheets. In **Java-based open-source applications**, this conversion enables engineers, researchers, and data analysts to extract measurement values, specifications, and vector-based details from CGM diagrams into editable FODS spreadsheets. As an ODF-compliant XML format, FODS ensures compatibility with tools like OpenOffice, making it easy to share and collaborate without proprietary constraints.


## ✅ Key Use Cases

- **Converting Graphical Technical Data into Spreadsheets**  
  Extract vector graphics data from CGM files into structured rows and columns for analysis.

- **Documenting Measurement Values**  
  Store and manage engineering measurements or experiment results in a portable spreadsheet format.

- **Sharing via ODF Tools**  
  Distribute CGM-derived spreadsheet data through ODF-compliant applications.


## ⚙️ Automation Scenarios

- **Java Libraries like JOpenDocument**  
  Automate CGM-to-FODS conversion in Java workflows using open-source spreadsheet handling libraries.

- **Headless LibreOffice Integration**  
  Run LibreOffice in headless mode from Java applications to batch-convert CGM graphics into FODS spreadsheets.

- **Mass FODS Generation**  
  Incorporate CGM parsing and FODS creation into Java-based ETL pipelines for large-scale data extraction.

- **Open-Source Data Processing Systems**  
  Use FODS as part of Java-powered scientific or engineering platforms for transparent, standards-based data management.
