Converting a PS file to a JPEG2000 image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the PS file to a JPEG image. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. It allows you to easily convert PS files to JPEG images with just a few lines of code. 
The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to a JPEG2000 image. Aspose.Imaging for Java is an advanced image processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. It provides a wide range of image processing capabilities, including the ability to render JPEG images to JPEG2000 images. With just a few lines of code, you can easily convert a JPEG image to a JPEG2000 image. 
In summary, converting a PS file to a JPEG2000 image in Java is a straightforward process that can be accomplished in two simple steps. By using the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the PS file to a JPEG image, and then using the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to a JPEG2000 image, you can quickly and easily convert a PS file to a JPEG2000 image in Java.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render PS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export PS file to JPEG2000 to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PS document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to JPEG2000. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

Using the API, you can also export PS file to JPEG2000 with watermark in your JPEG2000 document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert PS to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PS to JPEG2000 File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output JPEG2000 image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
