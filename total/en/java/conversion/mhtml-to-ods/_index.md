Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert MHTML to ODS. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render MHTML to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents in Java applications. It also provides the ability to render MHTML to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert MHTML to the XLSX format. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to ODS. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert spreadsheets in Java applications. It provides the ability to convert XLSX to ODS, allowing developers to easily convert the XLSX format to the ODS format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate the ability to convert MHTML to ODS into their Java applications. The two-step process involves using Aspose.PDF for Java to render MHTML to XLSX, and then using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to ODS. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily integrate this feature into their applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected MHTML to ODS via Java" %}}
If your MHTML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to ODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert MHTML File to ODS with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting MHTML file to ODS, you can also add watermark to your output ODS file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as ODS with Watermark.
