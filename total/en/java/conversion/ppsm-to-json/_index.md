Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.

While you are converting PPSM to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
