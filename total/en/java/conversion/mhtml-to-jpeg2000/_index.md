Converting an MHTML file to a JPEG2000 image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the MHTML file to a JPEG image. Aspose.PDF for Java is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with a variety of file formats. 

Once the MHTML file has been converted to a JPEG image, the second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to a JPEG2000 image. Aspose.Imaging for Java is an image processing API that provides a wide range of features for manipulating images, such as resizing, cropping, and rotating. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG2000. 

By using the two APIs provided by Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert an MHTML file to a JPEG2000 image in Java. The process is straightforward and requires minimal coding, making it an ideal solution for developers who need to quickly and easily convert MHTML files to JPEG2000 images.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render MHTML to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export MHTML file to JPEG2000 to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your MHTML document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to JPEG2000. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert MHTML to JPEG2000 With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export MHTML file to JPEG2000 with watermark in your JPEG2000 document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert MHTML to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate MHTML to JPEG2000 File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output JPEG2000 image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
