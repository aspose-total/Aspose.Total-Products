Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert JSON to DOCM in their Java applications. The two-step process involves using Aspose.Cells for Java to parse JSON to PDF and then using Aspose.Words for Java to convert the PDF to DOCM.

Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in Java applications. It provides a wide range of features such as creating and editing worksheets, formatting cells, adding charts and images, and more. It also supports the conversion of JSON to PDF, which is the first step in the process of converting JSON to DOCM.

Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents in Java applications. It provides a wide range of features such as creating and editing documents, formatting text, adding images, and more. It also supports the conversion of PDF to DOCM, which is the second step in the process of converting JSON to DOCM.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert JSON to DOCM in their Java applications. The two-step process involves using Aspose.Cells for Java to parse JSON to PDF and then using Aspose.Words for Java to convert the PDF to DOCM. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert JSON to DOCM in their Java applications.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to DOCM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON while parsing JSON to DOCM using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to DOCM with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to DOCM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your DOCM document, you can first convert the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to DOCM.

Converting **JSON to DOCM** is important for embedding **macros into Word documents** generated from structured data. This process enables organizations to combine raw datasets with powerful automation features inside Word, allowing for dynamic content generation, business rule execution, and interactive document functionality. By transforming JSON into DOCM files, enterprises can streamline workflows, enhance reporting, and build macro-enabled templates that adapt to evolving data needs.  

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}

- **Automated document workflows** – Drive repeatable document creation with embedded macros.  
- **Data analysis scripts** – Integrate JSON-driven macros for real-time calculations and processing.  
- **Macro-enabled templates** – Build reusable, intelligent templates for enterprise documentation.  
- **Enterprise reporting systems** – Generate reports with automated formatting and analysis.  
- **Interactive compliance forms** – Deliver forms with macro-enabled validation and processing rules.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}

- **JSON-to-DOCM pipelines** – Automate the transformation of structured datasets into macro-enabled Word files.  
- **Auto-triggered Word macros** – Execute macros dynamically during or after document generation.  
- **Dynamic business rule processing** – Apply enterprise policies and data rules directly within documents.  
- **Macro-enabled reporting automation** – Standardize and accelerate complex reporting workflows at scale.
