Converting an HTML file to an APNG image in Java can be done in two easy steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export HTML to JPEG. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG to APNG. 

The Aspose.PDF for Java API is a powerful tool that allows you to convert HTML to JPEG with ease. It supports a wide range of HTML elements, including tables, images, and text. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. The API also provides a range of features, such as the ability to set the page size, resolution, and orientation. 

The Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API is a powerful tool that allows you to render JPEG to APNG. It supports a wide range of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF. The API also provides a range of features, such as the ability to resize, crop, rotate, and flip images. It also supports a variety of image effects, such as blur, sharpen, and emboss. 

By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert HTML to APNG in Java. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with a variety of file formats. With these APIs, you can quickly and easily convert HTML to APNG in Java.

1. Open HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render HTML to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to APNG format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export HTML file to APNG to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your HTML document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to APNG. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to APNG format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to APNG With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export HTML file to APNG with watermark in your APNG document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert HTML to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as APNG format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate HTML to APNG File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output APNG image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
