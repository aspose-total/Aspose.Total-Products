Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily create, manipulate and convert various file formats within any Java application. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to convert JSON format to WMF in two simple steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to parse JSON to JPEG. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet component that enables developers to create, manipulate and convert spreadsheets in various formats, including JSON. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities, such as the ability to read and write JSON files, as well as convert them to other popular formats, such as JPEG. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for Java to convert JPEG to WMF. Aspose.Imaging for Java is an advanced imaging component that enables developers to create, manipulate and convert various image formats, including JPEG. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities, such as the ability to read and write JPEG files, as well as convert them to other popular formats, such as WMF. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert JSON format to WMF within any Java application in two simple steps. Firstly, by using Aspose.Cells for Java, developers can parse JSON to JPEG. After that, by using Aspose.Imaging for Java, developers can convert JPEG to WMF. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert JSON files to WMF format, without having to write any complex code.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as JPEG using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to WMF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to WMF with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to WMF with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to WMF with watermark in your WMF document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert JSON to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as WMF format.
