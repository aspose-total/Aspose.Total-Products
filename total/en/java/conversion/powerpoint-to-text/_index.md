[Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) File Format Automation libraries empower Java developers to automate the batch conversion process of PowerPoint POWERPOINT to Word TEXT. Converting the document is a two-step process and involves using two APIs. Weâ€™ll use [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) that is a PowerPoint API for presentations manipulation and management to convert POWERPOINT to HTML. After that by using feature-rich Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) we will convert the HTML to TEXT.

The API also allows you to perform POWERPOINT to TEXT conversion of password protected documents. If your input POWERPOINT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TEXT format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.

Using the API, you can also perform POWERPOINT file to TEXT conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your TEXT document, you can first convert the POWERPOINT  file to HTML and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created HTML file using the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions.
