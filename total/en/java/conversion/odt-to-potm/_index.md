Often times developers have to convert ODT file to POTM programmatically. By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can automate the rendering process in a few simple steps. You can load your ODT file by using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) and convert it to HTML. After that by using powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as POTM.

2. Convert ODT file to HTML by using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method
3. Initialize a new [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object
5. Extract content from HTML file using BufferedReader and write the content in your presentation file

For ODT to POTM file conversion, you can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/java).

Using the API, you can also perform ODT file to POTM conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POTM document, you can first export ODT to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to POTM.
