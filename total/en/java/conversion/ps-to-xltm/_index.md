Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate PS to XLTM conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render PS to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their Java applications. It also provides features such as document splitting, merging, and page extraction. 

Once the PS file has been converted to XLSX, the second step of the process is to convert XLSX to XLTM using Aspose.Cells for Java. Aspose.Cells for Java is a Spreadsheet Programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets from within their Java applications. It provides features such as data import and export, formula calculation engine, charting, and formatting. It also supports a wide range of spreadsheet formats, including XLSX, XLTM, XLS, CSV, and ODS.

If your PS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS File to XLTM with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting PS file to XLTM, you can also add watermark to your output XLTM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLTM with Watermark.
