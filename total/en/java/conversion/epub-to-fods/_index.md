{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected EPUB to FODS via Java" %}}
If your EPUB document is password protected, you cannot convert it to FODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB File to FODS with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB file to FODS, you can also add watermark to your output FODS file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as FODS with Watermark.
