Converting EPUB to FLATOPC is a simple two-step process that can be done using the powerful Document Processing API Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with documents.

The first step is to render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that can be used to convert EPUB to DOC. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to render EPUB to DOC.

Once the EPUB file has been rendered to DOC, the second step is to use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to FLATOPC. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that can be used to convert DOC to FLATOPC. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to convert DOC to FLATOPC.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert EPUB to FLATOPC in just two simple steps. First, you render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Then, you use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to FLATOPC. With Aspose.Total for Java, you can quickly and easily convert EPUB to FLATOPC.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to FLAT_OPC format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set FLAT_OPC as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected EPUB Document via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB to FLATOPC, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the EPUB using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.epub", "password");
// save EPUB as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save FLATOPC Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to FLATOPC file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your FLATOPC to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.FLAT_OPC);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
