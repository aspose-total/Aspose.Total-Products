Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert PostScript (PS) to PowerPoint Template (POT) within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components is designed to make it easy for developers to quickly and efficiently convert PS to POT without having to write any complex code.

The process of converting PS to POT begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is a powerful PDF Processing API that enables developers to export PS to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that make it easy to convert PS to PPTX, including the ability to convert multiple PS files to a single PPTX file, as well as the ability to set the page size, orientation, and margins of the output PPTX file.

Once the PS files have been converted to PPTX, developers can then use Aspose.Slides for Java, which is a powerful PowerPoint Processing API, to convert the PPTX to POT. This API provides a wide range of features that make it easy to convert PPTX to POT, including the ability to set the page size, orientation, and margins of the output POT file. Additionally, Aspose.Slides for Java also provides the ability to add text, images, and other objects to the output POT file, as well as the ability to customize the look and feel of the output POT file.

Overall, Aspose.Total for Java makes it easy for developers to quickly and efficiently convert PS to POT within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. By using Aspose.PDF for Java to export PS to PPTX, and then using Aspose.Slides for Java to convert the PPTX to POT, developers can easily and quickly convert PS to POT without having to write any complex code.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Pot` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted PS File via Java" %}}
While loading PS file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open PS document
Document doc = new Document("input.ps", "Your@Password");
// save PS as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save POT File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting PS to POT, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Pot format
presentation.save("output.pot", SaveFormat.Pot);
