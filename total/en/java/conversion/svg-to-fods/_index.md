Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert SVG to FODS. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render SVG to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents in Java applications. It also provides the ability to render SVG to XLSX, allowing developers to convert SVG files into XLSX format. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to FODS. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in Java applications. It provides the ability to convert XLSX to FODS, allowing developers to convert XLSX files into FODS format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate SVG to FODS conversion feature into their Java applications. The two-step process of using Aspose.PDF for Java to render SVG to XLSX and Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to FODS makes it easy to convert SVG files into FODS format. This feature can be used to create, edit, and manipulate FODS documents in Java applications.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to FODS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

If your SVG document is password protected, you cannot convert it to FODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting SVG file to FODS, you can also add watermark to your output FODS file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as FODS with Watermark.
