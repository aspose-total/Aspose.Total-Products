You can converting DOTX to XLSB via [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) is a simple two step process. By using feature-rich, document manipulation and conversion API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/), you can export DOTX to HTML.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input DOTX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSB without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

After you convert DOTX to XLSB, you can also encrypt and password protect your XLSB documents. In order to encrypt your document, open it using Workbook class and specify XOR Encryption Type and Strong Encryption type (RC4, Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider) encryption by using the setEncryptionOptions method. You can also set a password to your XLSB by using the Password property of WorkbookSettings class.
