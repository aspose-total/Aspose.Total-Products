Converting an MHTML file to an SVGZ image in Java can be done in two easy steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export MHTML to JPEG. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG to SVGZ. 

The Aspose.PDF for Java API is a powerful tool for creating, editing, and converting PDF documents. It can be used to export MHTML to JPEG, as well as other image formats such as PNG, TIFF, and BMP. It also supports a wide range of other features, such as text extraction, document manipulation, and digital signature creation. 

The Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API is a comprehensive library for manipulating images. It can be used to render JPEG to SVGZ, as well as other image formats such as PNG, TIFF, and BMP. It also supports a wide range of other features, such as image resizing, cropping, and color conversion. 

Both the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This package provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with a variety of file formats, including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. It also includes a range of other features, such as document conversion, document comparison, and document signing. 

By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert an MHTML file to an SVGZ image in Java. This process is simple and straightforward, and can be completed in just two steps. With the help of the Aspose.Total for Java package, you can quickly and easily convert MHTML to JPEG and then render JPEG to SVGZ.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render MHTML to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export MHTML file to SVGZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your MHTML document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to SVGZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert MHTML to SVGZ With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export MHTML file to SVGZ with watermark in your SVGZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert MHTML to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as SVGZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate MHTML to SVGZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output SVGZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
