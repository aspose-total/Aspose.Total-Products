Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate MHTML to CSV conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java, which allows developers to render MHTML to XLSX. Once the MHTML file has been converted to XLSX, the second step involves using the Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to CSV. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents without the need for any external dependencies. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to render MHTML to XLSX. This feature allows developers to easily convert MHTML files to XLSX, which can then be used in the second step of the process.

If your MHTML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to CSV without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting MHTML file to CSV, you can also add watermark to your output CSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as CSV with Watermark.
