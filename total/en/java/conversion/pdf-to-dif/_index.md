Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate PDF to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications. It consists of two powerful components, Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which can be used to render PDF to XLSX and convert XLSX to DIF respectively. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, convert, print, render and manipulate PDF documents without any external dependencies. It provides a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, image extraction, form filling, document signing, annotation, and much more. With the help of this API, developers can easily render PDF to XLSX format. 

Aspose.Cells for Java is a Spreadsheet Programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and print spreadsheets without any external dependencies. It provides a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, image extraction, form filling, document signing, annotation, and much more. With the help of this API, developers can easily convert XLSX to DIF format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate PDF to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications in two-step process. Firstly, they can render PDF to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for Java and then convert XLSX to DIF by using Aspose.Cells for Java. This two-step process makes it easy for developers to integrate PDF to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications.

If your PDF document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting PDF file to DIF, you can also add watermark to your output DIF file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as DIF with Watermark.
