Converting a PDF file to an IMAGE image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the PDF file to a JPEG image. This API is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with various file formats. Once the PDF file has been converted to a JPEG image, the second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG image to an IMAGE image. This API provides a wide range of image processing capabilities, including the ability to convert images from one format to another. 

The Aspose.PDF for Java API provides a range of features for working with PDF files, such as the ability to extract text, images, and annotations from PDF documents. It also provides the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. The Aspose.Imaging for Java API provides a comprehensive set of image processing capabilities, including the ability to resize, crop, rotate, and flip images. It also provides the ability to apply various filters and effects to images. 

By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert a PDF file to an IMAGE image in Java. The APIs provide a range of features for working with PDF and image files, making it easy to convert PDF files to IMAGE images.

1. Open PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render PDF to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export PDF file to IMAGE to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PDF document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to IMAGE. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to JPEG2000 format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF to IMAGE With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export PDF file to IMAGE with watermark in your IMAGE document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert PDF to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PDF to IMAGE File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output IMAGE image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
