By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can convert JSON to WORDML in your Java applications in two-step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/) you can parse JSON to PDF. In the second step, you can convert PDF to WORDML by using Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/).

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to WORDML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON while parsing JSON to WORDML using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to WORDML with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to WORDML with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your WORDML document, you can first convert the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to WORDML.

Converting **JSON to WORDML** is essential for producing **WordprocessingML (XML-based Word documents) from structured data**. WORDML enables seamless data exchange, template-driven document creation, and compatibility with XML-based workflows. By transforming JSON into WORDML, organizations can automate document generation, maintain structured content integrity, and support enterprise, government, and academic publishing efficiently.  

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}

- **Data exchange between systems** – Facilitate interoperable document formats for enterprise applications.  
- **Enterprise document storage** – Maintain structured, XML-based Word files for long-term storage.  
- **Template-based generation** – Automate the creation of standardized documents from templates.  
- **Government digital archives** – Produce compliant, XML-ready Word documents for official records.  
- **Structured academic publishing** – Generate research papers and educational content in a structured format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}

- **JSON-to-WordML pipelines** – Automate the conversion of structured data into XML-based Word documents.  
- **Automated XML document generation** – Streamline bulk document creation while maintaining structure.  
- **JSON-driven document workflows** – Populate WordML files directly from structured datasets.  
- **Enterprise-grade structured reporting** – Scale automated, structured document generation across departments efficiently.
