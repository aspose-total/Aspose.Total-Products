Converting a PostScript (PS) file to a Microsoft Word (DOCM) document can be done in two simple steps. The first step is to render the PS file to a DOC file using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to easily convert PS files to DOC files with just a few lines of code.

The second step is to convert the DOC file to a DOCM file using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to easily convert DOC files to DOCM files with just a few lines of code.

By using the two APIs from Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert PS files to DOCM files in just two simple steps. The first step is to render the PS file to a DOC file using Aspose.PDF for Java. The second step is to convert the DOC file to a DOCM file using Aspose.Words for Java. With just a few lines of code, you can quickly and easily convert PS files to DOCM files.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOCM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOCM as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java
// load PS file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.ps");
// save PS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.DOCM
outputDocument.save("output.docm", SaveFormat.DOCM);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected PS Document via Java" %}}
While converting PS to DOCM, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the PS using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.ps", "password");
// save PS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOCM Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOCM file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOCM to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.DOCM);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
