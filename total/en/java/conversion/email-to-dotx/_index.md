Email conversion is a powerful feature that Java developers can integrate within any Java J2SE, J2EE, J2ME applications via [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/). By using two APIs within the package you can convert Email EMAIL to DOTX without any third party dependencies. Firstly, you can use Email Manipulation API [Aspose.Email for Java](https://products.aspose.com/email/java/) to convert EMAIL file format to HTML. Secondly, you can render HTML to DOTX by using Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/).
