Converting a CGM file to a TGA image in Java can be done in two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for Java, a part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, can be used to export the CGM file to a JPEG image. Aspose.Imaging for Java, another part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, can then be used to render the JPEG image to a TGA image. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents without using Adobe Acrobat. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to export CGM files to JPEG images. It also supports a wide range of other features, such as creating and manipulating PDF documents, converting PDF documents to other formats, and extracting text and images from PDF documents. 

Aspose.Imaging for Java is a powerful image processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and manipulate images without using any external image editing software. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to render JPEG images to TGA images. It also supports a wide range of other features, such as creating and manipulating images, converting images to other formats, and extracting text and images from images. 

By using Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java, developers can easily convert CGM files to TGA images in Java. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides developers with a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating a wide range of file formats. With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily create, edit, convert, and manipulate a wide range of file formats, including PDF, CGM, JPEG, and TGA.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render CGM to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to TGA format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert CGM to TGA in a Single File via Java" %}}
The API also allows you to export CGM file to TGA to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your CGM document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to TGA. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to TGA format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert CGM to TGA With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export CGM file to TGA with watermark in your TGA document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert CGM to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as TGA format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate CGM to TGA File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output TGA image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
