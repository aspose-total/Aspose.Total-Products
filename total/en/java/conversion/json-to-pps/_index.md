Aspose.Total for Java is an all-in-one suite of components that enables developers to easily convert JSON format to PPS within any Java application. This suite includes Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Slides for Java, two powerful components that make the conversion process quick and easy.

Using Aspose.Cells for Java, developers can parse JSON to PPTX. This component provides a wide range of features, including the ability to read and write various file formats, such as XLSX, XLS, CSV, ODS, and more. It also offers a comprehensive set of APIs that allow developers to manipulate worksheets, cells, and charts.

Once the JSON data has been parsed to PPTX, Aspose.Slides for Java can be used to convert PPTX to PPS. This component provides a comprehensive set of APIs that allow developers to create, modify, and convert presentations. It also offers a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write various file formats, such as PPTX, PPT, PPSX, PPS, and more.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert JSON format to PPS within any Java application in two simple steps. Firstly, by using Aspose.Cells for Java, developers can parse JSON to PPTX. After that, by using Aspose.Slides for Java, developers can convert PPTX to PPS. This suite of components makes the conversion process quick and easy, allowing developers to save time and effort.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to PPS with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPS with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPS document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPS.
