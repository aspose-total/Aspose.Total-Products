Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate PDF to MD conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process starts with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is a powerful PDF manipulation API that allows developers to render PDF documents to XLSX format. Once the PDF document is converted to XLSX, the second step involves using the Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to MD format. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a feature-rich API that enables developers to create, edit, manipulate, and convert PDF documents without any external dependencies. It supports a wide range of features such as document manipulation, text extraction, image extraction, page manipulation, and more. It also provides support for rendering PDF documents to XLSX format, which is the first step in the PDF to MD conversion process.

If your PDF document is password protected, you cannot convert it to MD without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting PDF file to MD, you can also add watermark to your output MD file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as MD with Watermark.
