Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert PDF to SWF within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. The process involves two steps, both of which are made simple by the use of Aspose.Total for Java. 

The first step is to export the PDF to PPTX using Aspose.PDF for Java. This powerful PDF Processing API allows developers to convert PDF documents to a variety of other formats, including PPTX. It also provides a range of features for manipulating PDF documents, such as adding or removing pages, extracting text, and more. 

The second step is to convert the PPTX to SWF using Aspose.Slides for Java. This PowerPoint Processing API provides a range of features for creating, editing, and converting presentations. It also allows developers to export presentations to a variety of formats, including SWF. 

In summary, Aspose.Total for Java makes it easy to convert PDF to SWF within any Java application. By using Aspose.PDF for Java to export PDF to PPTX, and then Aspose.Slides for Java to convert PPTX to SWF, developers can quickly and easily convert PDF documents to SWF.

1. Open PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PDF to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Format APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java

Document document = new Document("template.pdf");
// save PDF as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted PDF File via Java" %}}
While loading PDF file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open PDF document
Document doc = new Document("input.pdf", "Your@Password");
// save PDF as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save SWF File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting PDF to SWF, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);
