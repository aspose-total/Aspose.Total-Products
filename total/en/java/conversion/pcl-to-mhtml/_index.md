Converting PCL to MHTML is a simple two-step process that can be done using the powerful Aspose.Total for Java package. Aspose.Total for Java is a suite of APIs that provide a comprehensive set of features for document processing. 

The first step is to render the PCL file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render PCL files to DOC format. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to MHTML using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents. It provides the ability to convert DOC files to MHTML format. 

By using the two APIs provided by Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert PCL to MHTML in just two simple steps. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provide a wide range of features for document processing. It is the perfect solution for developers who need to convert PCL to MHTML.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PCL to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to MHTML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set MHTML as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

// save PCL as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.MHTML
outputDocument.save("output.mhtml", SaveFormat.MHTML);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected PCL Document via Java" %}}
While converting PCL to MHTML, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the PCL using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.pcl", "password");
// save PCL as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MHTML Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to MHTML file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your MHTML to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.MHTML);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
