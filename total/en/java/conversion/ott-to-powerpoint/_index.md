Often times developers have to convert OTT file to POWERPOINT programmatically. By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can automate the rendering process in a few simple steps. You can load your OTT file by using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) and convert it to HTML. After that by using powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as POWERPOINT.

For OTT to POWERPOINT file conversion, you can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

Using the API, you can also perform OTT file to POWERPOINT conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POWERPOINT document, you can first export OTT to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to POWERPOINT.
