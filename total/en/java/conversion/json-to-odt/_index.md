1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to ODT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON while parsing JSON to ODT using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to ODT with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to ODT with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your ODT document, you can first convert the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to ODT.

Converting **JSON to ODT** is essential for generating **OpenDocument text files** from structured datasets. ODT, the native format for LibreOffice and OpenOffice, ensures long-term accessibility, open-source compatibility, and cross-platform interoperability. By transforming JSON into ODT, organizations can automate the creation of professional, data-backed text documents without manual editing.  

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}

- **Government documents** – Produce compliant, standardized documents for public administration.  
- **Open-source office workflows** – Integrate JSON data with LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice environments.  
- **Academic papers** – Generate research reports and publications from structured datasets.  
- **Business contracts** – Automate agreement drafting and contract creation from JSON records.  
- **Data-driven letters** – Create personalized, structured correspondence at scale.
