Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to integrate powerful features into their Java applications. It includes Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which can be used to convert PostScript (PS) to Excel Binary Spreadsheet (XLSB) format. 

The conversion process involves two steps. Firstly, Aspose.PDF for Java can be used to render the PS file to XLSX format. This is done by using the PdfSaveOptions class, which provides a range of options to control the output. Once the PS file is converted to XLSX, the second step is to convert the XLSX file to XLSB format. This can be done by using the Spreadsheet Programming API of Aspose.Cells for Java. This API provides a range of features to manipulate and convert spreadsheets. It also provides the ability to save the XLSX file to XLSB format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate the PS to XLSB conversion feature into their Java applications. The two-step process is simple and straightforward, and the output is of high quality. Aspose.Total for Java is a reliable and cost-effective solution for developers who need to convert PS to XLSB format.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to XLSB format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your PS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSB without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting PS file to XLSB, you can also add watermark to your output XLSB file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLSB with Watermark.
