Converting a PostScript (PS) file to MHTML is a simple two-step process. The first step is to render the PS file to a DOC file using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This package contains a suite of APIs that can be used to create, edit, and convert a variety of document formats.

Once the PS file has been rendered to a DOC file, the second step is to convert the DOC file to MHTML using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API can be used to convert a variety of document formats, including DOC, to MHTML.

By following these two simple steps, you can easily convert a PS file to MHTML. Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java are both powerful APIs that are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This package contains a suite of APIs that can be used to create, edit, and convert a variety of document formats.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to MHTML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set MHTML as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected PS Document via Java" %}}
While converting PS to MHTML, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the PS using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.ps", "password");
// save PS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MHTML Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to MHTML file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your MHTML to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.MHTML);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}  
```

Converting PS (PostScript) files to MHTML (MIME HTML) enables complete PostScript documents—including text, graphics, and images—to be saved as single, portable web pages. MHTML is ideal for archival, sharing, and web-based presentation of PostScript content.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}

* Archiving PS reports and manuals as standalone web pages.
* Converting PostScript documentation for offline browser access.
* Sharing complex PS diagrams and layouts in a single file.
* Preserving original PS formatting in web-compatible HTML archives.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}

* Batch PS-to-MHTML conversion for archival and record-keeping.
* Integration into document management systems for web distribution.
* Cloud-based generation of offline-viewable HTML from PS files.
* Automated transformation for email-ready reports and visual content.
