Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert EPUB to OTP within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components is designed to provide developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications that can manipulate documents in a variety of formats.

The process of converting EPUB to OTP begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java. This component allows developers to export EPUB documents to PPTX, which is the PowerPoint format. Once the document has been exported, developers can then use Aspose.Slides for Java to convert the PPTX document to OTP. Aspose.Slides for Java is a powerful PowerPoint Processing API that provides developers with the ability to manipulate PowerPoint documents in a variety of ways.

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert EPUB documents to OTP. This suite of components provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications that can manipulate documents in a variety of formats. With Aspose.PDF for Java, developers can export EPUB documents to PPTX, and then with Aspose.Slides for Java, they can convert the PPTX document to OTP. This makes it easy for developers to create powerful applications that can manipulate documents in a variety of formats.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted EPUB File via Java" %}}
While loading EPUB file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("input.epub", "Your@Password");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save OTP File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting EPUB to OTP, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Otp format
presentation.save("output.otp", SaveFormat.Otp);    
```
