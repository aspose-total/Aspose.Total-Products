Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert SVG to MD. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render SVG to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render SVG to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert SVG to XLSX. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to MD. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert spreadsheets. It also provides the ability to convert XLSX to MD, allowing developers to easily convert XLSX to MD. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate the ability to convert SVG to MD into their Java applications. The two-step process of using Aspose.PDF for Java to render SVG to XLSX and then using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to MD makes it easy to integrate this feature into any Java application.

If your SVG document is password protected, you cannot convert it to MD without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert SVG File to MD with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting SVG file to MD, you can also add watermark to your output MD file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as MD with Watermark.
