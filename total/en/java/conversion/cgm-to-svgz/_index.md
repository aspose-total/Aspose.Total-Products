Converting a CGM file to an SVGZ image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, to export the CGM file to a JPEG image. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG image to an SVGZ image. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their Java applications. It supports a wide range of file formats, including CGM, and can be used to export CGM files to JPEG images. 

Aspose.Imaging for Java is an advanced image processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert images from within their Java applications. It supports a wide range of image formats, including SVGZ, and can be used to render JPEG images to SVGZ images. 

By combining the power of Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java, developers can easily convert CGM files to SVGZ images in Java. This process is made even easier by the fact that both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides developers with a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating a wide range of file formats.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render CGM to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export CGM file to SVGZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your CGM document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to SVGZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

Using the API, you can also export CGM file to SVGZ with watermark in your SVGZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert CGM to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as SVGZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate CGM to SVGZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output SVGZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
