Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert MHTML to PPSX within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components is designed to provide developers with the tools they need to quickly and easily create powerful applications.

The process of converting MHTML to PPSX begins with Aspose.PDF for Java. This component enables developers to export MHTML to PPTX. This is done by using the MHTMLSaveOptions class, which provides a range of options for controlling the output of the conversion. Once the MHTML has been converted to PPTX, the next step is to use Aspose.Slides for Java. This component provides a powerful PowerPoint Processing API that enables developers to convert PPTX to PPSX. This is done by using the Presentation class, which provides a range of methods for controlling the output of the conversion.

Once the conversion is complete, developers can use the output PPSX file in their applications. This file can be used to create presentations, slideshows, and other documents. Aspose.Total for Java makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert MHTML to PPSX within any Java application. With this suite of components, developers can create powerful applications that can handle a wide range of file formats.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MHTML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPSX format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Ppsx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted MHTML File via Java" %}}
While loading MHTML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open MHTML document
Document doc = new Document("input.mhtml", "Your@Password");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PPSX File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting MHTML to PPSX, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Ppsx format
presentation.save("output.ppsx", SaveFormat.Ppsx);
