Converting SVG to GIF is a simple two-step process. The first step is to render the SVG file to DOC using the powerful Aspose.PDF for Java API. Aspose.PDF for Java is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which is a comprehensive suite of document processing APIs. Once the SVG file is rendered to DOC, the second step is to use the Aspose.Words for Java API to convert the DOC to GIF. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that can be used to convert DOC to GIF.

The Aspose.PDF for Java API is a powerful library that can be used to render SVG files to DOC. It is a feature-rich API that supports a wide range of features such as text extraction, image extraction, page manipulation, and more. The API also supports a variety of image formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and more.

The Aspose.Words for Java API is a powerful document processing API that can be used to convert DOC to GIF. It is a feature-rich API that supports a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, image manipulation, and more. The API also supports a variety of image formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and more.

Both the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of document processing APIs that can be used to create, edit, and convert a variety of document formats. The package also includes APIs for working with spreadsheets, presentations, and emails.

In summary, converting SVG to GIF is a simple two-step process. First, use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to render the SVG file to DOC. Then, use the Aspose.Words for Java API to convert the DOC to GIF. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which is a comprehensive suite of document processing APIs.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to GIF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set GIF as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.GIF
outputDocument.save("output.gif", SaveFormat.GIF);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected SVG Document via Java" %}}
While converting SVG to GIF, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the SVG using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.svg", "password");
// save SVG as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save GIF Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to GIF file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your GIF to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.GIF);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
