1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted EPUB File via Java" %}}
While loading EPUB file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("input.epub", "Your@Password");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XAML File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting EPUB to XAML, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Xaml format
presentation.save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);    
```

Converting **EPUB to XAML** is essential for generating **UI-friendly markup** from eBook content. XAML files enable designers and developers to create interactive, scalable, and Windows-compatible user interfaces directly from publication content. By transforming EPUB into XAML, teams can streamline application prototyping, improve UI/UX workflows, and integrate publication assets into Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) projects.  

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}  
- **Application prototyping** – Rapidly convert content into interface-ready markup for apps.  
- **UI/UX workflows** – Integrate eBook elements into interactive design systems.  
- **Cross-platform publishing** – Adapt content for multi-device and multi-platform UI projects.  
- **Interactive design** – Build dynamic and responsive interfaces from textual and visual content.  
- **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) integration** – Seamlessly use publication content in WPF applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}  
- **EPUB-to-XAML pipelines** – Automate the conversion of eBooks into markup-ready files.  
- **Automated markup extraction** – Extract UI elements efficiently for design use.  
- **Bulk UI generation** – Produce multiple interface-ready files from large publication libraries.  
- **Enterprise-level app design workflows** – Integrate EPUB-to-XAML conversion into scalable software development pipelines.
