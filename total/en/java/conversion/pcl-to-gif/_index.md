Converting PCL to GIF can be done in two simple steps using Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a powerful suite of APIs that can be used to manipulate documents and images. 

The first step is to render the PCL file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that can be used to render PCL files to DOC. It can also be used to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to GIF using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that can be used to convert DOC files to GIF. It can also be used to create, edit, and convert Word documents. 

Using Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert PCL to GIF in two simple steps. First, you render the PCL file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Then, you convert the DOC file to GIF using Aspose.Words for Java. With Aspose.Total for Java, you can quickly and easily convert PCL to GIF.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PCL to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to GIF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set GIF as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java

Document document = new Document("template.pcl");
// save PCL as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.GIF
outputDocument.save("output.gif", SaveFormat.GIF);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected PCL Document via Java" %}}
While converting PCL to GIF, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the PCL using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.pcl", "password");
// save PCL as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save GIF Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to GIF file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your GIF to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.GIF);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
