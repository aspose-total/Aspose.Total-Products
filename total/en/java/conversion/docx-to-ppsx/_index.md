Often times developers have to convert DOCX file to PPSX programmatically. By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can automate the rendering process in a few simple steps. You can load your DOCX file by using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) and convert it to HTML. After that by using powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPSX.

The API also allows you to convert password-protected DOCX documents to PPSX. If your input DOCX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPSX format without using the password. In order to open a encrypted document you can set the correct password in LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.

After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPSX.
