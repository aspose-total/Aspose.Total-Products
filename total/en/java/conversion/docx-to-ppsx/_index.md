Developers often need to convert DOCX files to PPSX programmatically. Fortunately, this process can be automated with the help of the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/). This library provides a few simple steps to render the conversion process. 

The first step is to load the DOCX file using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). This library allows you to convert the file to HTML. Once the file is converted, you can use the powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) to create a new Presentation. This library allows you to write HTML content into the Presentation and save it as a PPSX file. 

The File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) provide a comprehensive solution for developers to automate the conversion process from DOCX to PPSX. By using the powerful libraries [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/), developers can easily convert the file and save it as a PPSX file. This library provides a simple and efficient way to automate the conversion process and save time and effort.

The API also allows you to convert password-protected DOCX documents to PPSX. If your input DOCX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPSX format without using the password. In order to open a encrypted document you can set the correct password in LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.

Using the API, you can also perform DOCX file to PPSX conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPSX document, you can first export DOCX to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPSX.
