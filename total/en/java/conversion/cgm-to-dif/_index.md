Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate CGM to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which are two powerful APIs that can be used to render CGM to XLSX and convert XLSX to DIF respectively. 

The process of converting CGM to DIF involves two steps. In the first step, Aspose.PDF for Java can be used to render CGM to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents in their Java applications. It also supports CGM to XLSX conversion, which can be done by using the PdfSaveOptions class. This class provides various options that can be used to control the output of the conversion process. 

In the second step, Aspose.Cells for Java can be used to convert XLSX to DIF. This API provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in their Java applications. It also supports XLSX to DIF conversion, which can be done by using the Workbook class. This class provides various methods that can be used to control the output of the conversion process. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate CGM to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite provides powerful APIs that enable developers to render CGM to XLSX and convert XLSX to DIF in two-step process. It also provides various options and methods that can be used to control the output of the conversion process.

If your CGM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting CGM file to DIF, you can also add watermark to your output DIF file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as DIF with Watermark.
