Converting an epub file to SVGZ image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export an EPUB file to a JPEG image. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG image to an SVGZ image. 
The Aspose.PDF for Java API is a powerful tool for creating, editing, and manipulating PDF documents. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to export EPUB files to JPEG images. The API also supports a variety of other formats, such as HTML, XPS, and TIFF. 
The Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API is a comprehensive library for manipulating images. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to render JPEG images to SVGZ images. The API also supports a variety of other image formats, such as PNG, BMP, and GIF. 
Using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can easily convert an epub file to an SVGZ image in Java. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with documents and images. With these APIs, you can quickly and easily convert an epub file to an SVGZ image in Java.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export EPUB file to SVGZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to SVGZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to SVGZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to SVGZ With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export EPUB file to SVGZ with watermark in your SVGZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert EPUB to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as SVGZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate EPUB to SVGZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output SVGZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
