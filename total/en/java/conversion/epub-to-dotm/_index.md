Converting EPUB to DOTM is a simple two-step process that can be done with the help of Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides powerful document processing capabilities. 

The first step is to render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render EPUB files to DOC format. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to DOTM using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate Word documents. It also provides the ability to convert DOC files to DOTM format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily convert EPUB to DOTM in just two simple steps. Aspose.Total for Java provides a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to create, edit, convert, and manipulate a wide range of document formats. It is the perfect solution for developers who need to work with documents in their applications.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOTM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOTM as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected EPUB Document via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB to DOTM, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the EPUB using the owner’s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOTM Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOTM file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOTM to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.DOTM);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}  
```

Converting **EPUB to DOTM** is crucial for generating **macro-enabled Word templates** from eBooks and digital publications. DOTM files allow advanced automation through embedded macros, enabling publishers, researchers, and enterprises to streamline workflows, reduce manual effort, and standardize content creation. By transforming EPUB into DOTM, organizations can integrate dynamic functions into reusable templates, ensuring efficiency and consistency across academic, business, and educational documentation.  

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}  
- **Automated publishing templates** – Speed up eBook-to-template conversions for large catalogs.  
- **Research and academic automation** – Create standardized, macro-powered frameworks for studies.  
- **Business intelligence templates** – Automate reporting, data integration, and structured content.  
- **Educational content frameworks** – Build macro-enabled course and learning material templates.  
- **Workflow-driven templates** – Integrate macros to automate repetitive publishing tasks.
