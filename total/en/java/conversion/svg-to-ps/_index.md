Converting SVG to PS can be done in two simple steps using Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a powerful suite of APIs that allow developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents in various formats. 

The first step is to render the SVG file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, read, and manipulate PDF documents. It also allows developers to convert PDF documents to other formats such as DOC, HTML, and SVG. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to PS using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, read, and manipulate documents in various formats. It also allows developers to convert documents from one format to another, such as DOC to PS. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert SVG to PS in two simple steps. First, they can render the SVG file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Then, they can convert the DOC file to PS using Aspose.Words for Java. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert SVG to PS.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to PS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set PS as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java
// load SVG file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.svg");
// save SVG as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.PS
outputDocument.save("output.ps", SaveFormat.PS);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected SVG Document via Java" %}}
While converting SVG to PS, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the SVG using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.svg", "password");
// save SVG as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PS Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to PS file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your PS to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.PS);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
