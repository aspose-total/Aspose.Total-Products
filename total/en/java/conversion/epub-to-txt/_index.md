Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert EPUB files to TXT files. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the EPUB file to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents in their Java applications. It can be used to render EPUB files to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert EPUB files to other formats. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to TXT. Aspose.Cells for Java is a spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert spreadsheets in their Java applications. It can be used to convert XLSX files to TXT, allowing developers to easily convert EPUB files to TXT. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate EPUB to TXT conversion feature into their Java applications. It provides a two-step process that enables developers to render EPUB files to XLSX and then convert XLSX to TXT. This makes it easy for developers to convert EPUB files to TXT in their Java applications.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to TXT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your EPUB document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TXT without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting EPUB file to TXT, you can also add watermark to your output TXT file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as TXT with Watermark.
