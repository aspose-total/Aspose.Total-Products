If your PDF document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting PDF file to XLSM, you can also add watermark to your output XLSM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLSM with Watermark.
