Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert MHTML to PPTM within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components is designed to provide developers with the tools they need to quickly and easily convert MHTML to PPTM.

The process of converting MHTML to PPTM begins with Aspose.PDF for Java. This component enables developers to export MHTML to PPTX. This is done by using the MHTML to PPTX conversion feature of Aspose.PDF for Java. Once the MHTML has been converted to PPTX, the next step is to use Aspose.Slides for Java to convert the PPTX to PPTM. Aspose.Slides for Java is a PowerPoint Processing API that provides developers with the ability to convert PPTX to PPTM.

Once the MHTML has been converted to PPTM, developers can then use the PPTM file in their Java applications. Aspose.Total for Java makes it easy for developers to convert MHTML to PPTM and use the PPTM file in their applications. With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert MHTML to PPTM and use the PPTM file in their Java applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted MHTML File via Java" %}}
While loading MHTML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open MHTML document
Document doc = new Document("input.mhtml", "Your@Password");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PPTM File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting MHTML to PPTM, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Pptm format
presentation.save("output.pptm", SaveFormat.Pptm);
