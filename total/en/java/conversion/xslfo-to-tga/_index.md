Converting an XSLFO file to a TGA image in Java can be done in two simple steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export XSLFO to JPEG. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG to TGA. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their Java applications. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to export XSLFO to JPEG. It also provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating PDF documents, such as adding text, images, and annotations, as well as merging, splitting, and extracting pages. 

Aspose.Imaging for Java is an advanced image processing API that enables developers to manipulate images in a variety of formats, including TGA. It provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating images, such as resizing, cropping, rotating, and flipping. It also supports a wide range of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF. With this API, you can easily render a JPEG to TGA. 

By combining the features of Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java, you can easily convert an XSLFO file to a TGA image in Java. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating documents, images, and other file formats. With this package, you can easily create, edit, convert, and print documents and images from within your Java applications.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render XSLFO to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to TGA format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to export XSLFO file to TGA to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your XSLFO document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to TGA. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to TGA format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert XSLFO to TGA With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export XSLFO file to TGA with watermark in your TGA document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert XSLFO to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as TGA format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate XSLFO to TGA File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output TGA image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
