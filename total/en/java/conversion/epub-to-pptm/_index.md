Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert EPUB to PPTM within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of APIs is designed to provide developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications that can manipulate documents, images, and other file formats.

The process of converting EPUB to PPTM begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java. This API allows developers to export EPUB to PPTX, which is a PowerPoint file format. Once the EPUB has been converted to PPTX, developers can then use Aspose.Slides for Java to convert the PPTX to PPTM. Aspose.Slides for Java is a PowerPoint Processing API that provides developers with the ability to manipulate PowerPoint documents.

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert EPUB to PPTM within any Java application. The process begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java to export EPUB to PPTX. After that, Aspose.Slides for Java can be used to convert the PPTX to PPTM. This suite of APIs provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications that can manipulate documents, images, and other file formats.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Pptm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted EPUB File via Java" %}}
While loading EPUB file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("input.epub", "Your@Password");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PPTM File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting EPUB to PPTM, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Pptm format
presentation.save("output.pptm", SaveFormat.Pptm);    
```
