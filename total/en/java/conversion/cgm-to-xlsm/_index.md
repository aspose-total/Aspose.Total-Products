1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to XLSM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your CGM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting CGM file to XLSM, you can also add watermark to your output XLSM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLSM with Watermark.

Converting CGM files to **XLSM (Macro-Enabled Excel Workbook)** format in Java-based systems allows organizations to automate engineering calculations, reporting, and visualization workflows. With XLSM, macros can dynamically process CGM-derived data, perform complex computations, and update charts or diagrams without manual intervention. This enables smarter, self-updating reports for technical and operational use cases.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}
- Automated engineering report generation with embedded macros.
- Dynamic calculation workflows for manufacturing or design data.
- Integration of CGM diagrams into Excel models with macro logic.
- Streamlined quality control processes via macro-enabled analysis.
