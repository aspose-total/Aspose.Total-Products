Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate PCL to XLSM conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite consists of two components, Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to render PCL to XLSX. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, converting, and manipulating PDF documents. It also supports a variety of formats such as PDF, XPS, TIFF, HTML, and many more. With this API, developers can easily render PCL to XLSX in a few lines of code. 

Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to convert XLSX to XLSM. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, formatting, and manipulating spreadsheets. It also supports a variety of formats such as XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, CSV, and many more. With this API, developers can easily convert XLSX to XLSM in a few lines of code. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate PCL to XLSM conversion feature in their Java applications in two-step process. Firstly, by using Aspose.PDF for Java, developers can render PCL to XLSX. In the second step, developers can convert XLSX to XLSM by using Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java. This suite of components provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to easily integrate PCL to XLSM conversion feature in their Java applications.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PCL to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to XLSM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your PCL document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting PCL file to XLSM, you can also add watermark to your output XLSM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLSM with Watermark.
