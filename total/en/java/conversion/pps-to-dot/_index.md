[Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) File Format Automation libraries empower Java developers to automate the batch conversion process of PowerPoint PPS to Word DOT. Converting the document is a two-step process and involves using two APIs. We’ll use [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) that is a PowerPoint API for presentations manipulation and management to convert PPS to HTML. After that by using feature-rich Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) we will convert the HTML to DOT.

1. Open PPS file using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class
2. Convert PPS to HTML by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-com.aspose.slides.ISaveOptions-) method and set Html as SaveFormat
3. Load the converted HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class
4. Save the document to DOT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method

For PPS to DOT file conversion, you can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/java).

Using the API, you can also perform PPS file to DOT conversion with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your DOT document, you can first convert the PPS  file to HTML and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created HTML file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions.
