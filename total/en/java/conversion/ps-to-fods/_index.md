Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate a wide range of features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the ability to convert PostScript (PS) files to Flat Open Document Spreadsheet (FODS) files. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the PS file to an XLSX file. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert PDF documents without any external dependencies. It also provides the ability to render PS files to XLSX files, allowing developers to easily convert PS files to XLSX. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX file to a FODS file. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert spreadsheets without any external dependencies. It also provides the ability to convert XLSX files to FODS files, allowing developers to easily convert XLSX files to FODS. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate PS to FODS conversion feature into their Java applications. The two-step process of using Aspose.PDF for Java to render PS to XLSX and then using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to FODS makes it easy to convert PS files to FODS files. This makes it possible for developers to quickly and easily integrate PS to FODS conversion feature into their Java applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected PS to FODS via Java" %}}
If your PS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to FODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS File to FODS with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting PS file to FODS, you can also add watermark to your output FODS file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as FODS with Watermark.
