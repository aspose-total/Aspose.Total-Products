Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert XML to POWERPOINT within any Java J2SE, J2EE, J2ME application. This suite of components provides a wide range of features and capabilities that make it easy to create, edit, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations. 

The process of converting XML to POWERPOINT begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java. This component allows developers to export XML to PPTX, which is the native PowerPoint format. Once the XML has been exported to PPTX, the next step is to use Aspose.Slides for Java. This PowerPoint Processing API provides developers with the ability to convert PPTX to POWERPOINT. This API also provides a wide range of features and capabilities that make it easy to create, edit, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations. 

Aspose.Total for Java makes it easy to convert XML to POWERPOINT within any Java J2SE, J2EE, J2ME application. By using Aspose.PDF for Java to export XML to PPTX, and then using Aspose.Slides for Java to convert PPTX to POWERPOINT, developers can quickly and easily create, edit, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations. This suite of components provides a wide range of features and capabilities that make it easy to create, edit, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Ppt` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted XML File via Java" %}}
While loading XML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml", "Your@Password");
// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save POWERPOINT File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting XML to POWERPOINT, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Ppt format
presentation.save("output.ppt", SaveFormat.Ppt);
