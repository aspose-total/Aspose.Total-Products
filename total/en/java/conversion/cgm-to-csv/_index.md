Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate CGM to CSV conversion feature in their Java applications. This two-step process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render CGM to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents without any external dependencies. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to render CGM to XLSX.

Once the CGM file has been rendered to XLSX, the second step of the process is to convert XLSX to CSV. This can be done using Aspose.Cells for Java, a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, edit, and manipulate spreadsheets without any external dependencies. Aspose.Cells for Java supports a wide range of features, including the ability to convert XLSX to CSV.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate CGM to CSV conversion feature in their Java applications. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render CGM to XLSX, and Aspose.Cells for Java is used to convert XLSX to CSV. Both components are part of the Aspose.Total for Java suite, which provides developers with a comprehensive set of components for manipulating documents, spreadsheets, and other file formats.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to CSV format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your CGM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to CSV without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting CGM file to CSV, you can also add watermark to your output CSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as CSV with Watermark.

Converting CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) files to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) in Java-based environments allows engineering, manufacturing, and data analysis teams to transform graphical vector data into structured tabular formats. This enables easy attribute extraction, metadata analysis, and integration with Java-driven analytics pipelines. Using Java CSV libraries such as **OpenCSV**, CGM-to-CSV workflows can automate large-scale processing while ensuring compatibility with BI tools and reporting platforms.
