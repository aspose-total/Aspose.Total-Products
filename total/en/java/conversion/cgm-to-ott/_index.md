Converting CGM to OTT is a simple two-step process that can be done using the powerful Aspose.Total for Java package. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that allow developers to create, manipulate, and convert a variety of document formats. 

The first step in the process is to render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that allows developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render CGM files to DOC format. 

Once the CGM file has been rendered to DOC, the second step is to use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to OTT. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that allows developers to create, edit, and convert a variety of document formats. It also provides the ability to convert DOC files to OTT format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert CGM to OTT in just two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render the CGM file to DOC, and Aspose.Words for Java is used to convert the DOC to OTT. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert CGM to OTT without having to use any additional tools or software.

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to OTT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the owner’s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save OTT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to OTT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your OTT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement.
