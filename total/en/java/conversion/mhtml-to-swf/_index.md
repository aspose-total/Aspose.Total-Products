Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert MHTML to SWF within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components provides a powerful and efficient way to convert MHTML to SWF without any manual intervention. 

The process of converting MHTML to SWF begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java. This component allows developers to export MHTML to PPTX, which is a PowerPoint presentation format. Once the MHTML has been converted to PPTX, the next step is to use Aspose.Slides for Java. This PowerPoint Processing API enables developers to convert PPTX to SWF, which is a Shockwave Flash file format. 

The conversion process is simple and straightforward. All that is required is to add the Aspose.Total for Java components to the project, and then use the provided APIs to convert MHTML to SWF. The conversion process is fast and efficient, and the resulting SWF file is of high quality. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for Java is an ideal solution for developers who need to quickly and easily convert MHTML to SWF. The suite of components is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to convert MHTML to SWF. With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert MHTML to SWF within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MHTML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Format APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java
// load MHTML file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.mhtml");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted MHTML File via Java" %}}
While loading MHTML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open MHTML document
Document doc = new Document("input.mhtml", "Your@Password");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save SWF File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting MHTML to SWF, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);
