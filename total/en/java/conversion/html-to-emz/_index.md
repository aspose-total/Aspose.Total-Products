Converting an HTML file to an EMZ image in Java can be done in two easy steps. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to export HTML to JPEG. The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java Image Processing API to render the JPEG to EMZ. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their Java applications. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to export HTML to JPEG. This API also supports a variety of other features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF documents, as well as the ability to add annotations, watermarks, and digital signatures to PDF documents.

Aspose.Imaging for Java is an advanced image processing API that enables developers to manipulate images from within their Java applications. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to render JPEG to EMZ. This API also supports a variety of other features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert images, as well as the ability to apply various effects and transformations to images.

By using Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java, you can easily convert an HTML file to an EMZ image in Java. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides developers with a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating a variety of file formats from within their Java applications.

1. Open HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render HTML to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to EMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to EMZ in a Single File via Java" %}}
The API also allows you to export HTML file to EMZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your HTML document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to EMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to EMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to EMZ With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export HTML file to EMZ with watermark in your EMZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert HTML to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as EMZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate HTML to EMZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output EMZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).
