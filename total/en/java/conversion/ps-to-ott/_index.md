Converting a PS file to OTT format can be done quickly and easily with the help of two powerful APIs from Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java are the two APIs that can be used to render a PS file to DOC and then convert it to OTT respectively.

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF rendering and manipulation API that can be used to render a PS file to DOC. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, converting, and manipulating PDF documents. It also supports a variety of formats such as PDF, XPS, TIFF, SVG, and many more.

Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that can be used to convert DOC to OTT. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, converting, and manipulating documents. It supports a variety of formats such as DOC, DOCX, ODT, OTT, and many more.

Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for Java package, which is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to create, edit, convert, and manipulate a variety of documents. It also provides a wide range of features such as document comparison, document signing, and many more.

In conclusion, converting a PS file to OTT format can be done quickly and easily with the help of two powerful APIs from Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java are the two APIs that can be used to render a PS file to DOC and then convert it to OTT respectively.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to OTT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set OTT as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected PS Document via Java" %}}
While converting PS to OTT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the PS using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.ps", "password");
// save PS as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save OTT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to OTT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your OTT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.OTT);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}

Converting PS (PostScript) files to OTT (OpenDocument Text Template) allows teams to create standardized, reusable text document templates. OTT templates are ideal for recurring reports, letters, or forms, leveraging PostScript layouts for consistent formatting.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}

* Creating reusable text templates from PS-based reports and documents.
* Standardizing letters, forms, and internal reports across teams.
* Converting PS-generated manuals into editable OTT templates.
* Preparing PostScript layouts for recurring documentation in open-source environments.
