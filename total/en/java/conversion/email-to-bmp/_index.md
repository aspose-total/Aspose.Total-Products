Email conversion is a powerful feature that Java developers can integrate within any Java J2SE, J2EE, J2ME applications via [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/). By using two APIs within the package you can convert Email EMAIL to BMP without any third party dependencies. Firstly, you can use Email Manipulation API [Aspose.Email for Java](https://products.aspose.com/email/java/) to convert EMAIL file format to HTML. Secondly, you can render HTML to BMP by using Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/).

1. Open EMAIL file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mailmessage) class
2. Convert EMAIL to HTML by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/MailMessage#save(java.io.OutputStream,%20com.aspose.email.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to BMP format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method and set BMP as SaveFormat

Converting emails into **Bitmap (BMP)** format ensures compatibility with older systems and raw image processing workflows. With Java Email API, email messages can be exported into BMP for archival, forensic, and legacy integrations.


{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}

- **Legacy Systems**: Store email images in BMP for compatibility with older software.  
- **Forensic Evidence**: Preserve email layouts as uncompressed bitmaps for investigations.  
- **Medical/Scientific Archives**: Use BMP for industries that rely on raw image fidelity.  
- **Training Resources**: Embed email images into training manuals.  
- **Offline Viewing**: Save emails as BMP for systems without advanced rendering tools.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}

- **Archiving Pipelines**: Convert emails into BMP for immutable records.  
- **Batch Export**: Mass-convert email communications into BMP for evidence storage.  
- **Legacy Integrations**: Feed BMP email captures into old systems that require bitmap input.  
- **Compliance Workflows**: Store official correspondence as BMP images.  
- **Training Automation**: Generate BMP images from phishing emails for awareness programs.
