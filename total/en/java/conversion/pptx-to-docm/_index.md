[Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) File Format Automation libraries empower Java developers to automate the batch conversion process of PowerPoint PPTX to Word DOCM. Converting the document is a two-step process and involves using two APIs. Weâ€™ll use [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) that is a PowerPoint API for presentations manipulation and management to convert PPTX to HTML. After that by using feature-rich Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) we will convert the HTML to DOCM.

The API also allows you to perform PPTX to DOCM conversion of password protected documents. If your input PPTX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DOCM format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.
