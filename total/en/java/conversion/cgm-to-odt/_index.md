Converting a CGM file to ODT can be done in two easy steps using Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a powerful suite of APIs that allow developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents in a variety of formats. 

The first step is to render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that allows developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also allows developers to render CGM files to DOC. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to ODT using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that allows developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents in a variety of formats. It also allows developers to convert DOC files to ODT. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert CGM files to ODT in two simple steps. First, they can render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Then, they can convert the DOC file to ODT using Aspose.Words for Java. This makes it easy for developers to convert CGM files to ODT quickly and easily.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to ODT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set ODT as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to ODT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the ownerâ€™s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save ODT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to ODT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your ODT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement.
