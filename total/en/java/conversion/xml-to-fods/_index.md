Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate XML to FODS conversion feature in their Java applications. This two-step process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render XML to XLSX. Once the XML is converted to XLSX, the second step involves using the Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX to FODS.

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that enables developers to create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents without any external dependencies. It provides a wide range of features such as text extraction, document manipulation, page manipulation, and more. It also supports the conversion of XML to XLSX, which is the first step in the XML to FODS conversion process.

The second step in the process involves using Aspose.Cells for Java, which is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets. It supports a wide range of features such as data validation, formatting, charting, and more. It also supports the conversion of XLSX to FODS, which is the second step in the XML to FODS conversion process.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate XML to FODS conversion feature in their Java applications. This two-step process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render XML to XLSX. Once the XML is converted to XLSX, the second step involves using the Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX to FODS. This process is simple and efficient, and it enables developers to quickly and easily integrate XML to FODS conversion feature in their Java applications.

If your XML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to FODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert XML File to FODS with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting XML file to FODS, you can also add watermark to your output FODS file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as FODS with Watermark.
