Converting an HTML file to a WMZ image in Java is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.PDF for Java API to export the HTML file to a JPEG image. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to easily convert HTML to JPEG with just a few lines of code. 

The second step is to use the Aspose.Imaging for Java API to render the JPEG image to a WMZ image. Aspose.Imaging for Java is an advanced image processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API provides a wide range of image processing capabilities, including the ability to render JPEG images to WMZ. With just a few lines of code, you can easily convert a JPEG image to a WMZ image. 

By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Imaging for Java APIs, you can quickly and easily convert an HTML file to a WMZ image in Java. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other file formats. With just a few lines of code, you can easily convert HTML to WMZ in Java.

1. Open HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize class object and render HTML to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to WMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to WMZ in a Single File via Java" %}}
The API also allows you to export HTML file to WMZ to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your HTML document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export the TIFF file to WMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to WMZ format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to WMZ With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also export HTML file to WMZ with watermark in your WMZ document. In order to add a watermark to you can first convert HTML to JPEG and add a watermark in it. In order to add watermark, load an image file using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as WMZ format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate HTML to WMZ File via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output WMZ image as per your needs. The Image.rotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. The library provides simple methods to perform complex operations while encapsulating all ugly details. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class and call the Image.rotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/RotateFlipType).

Converting **HTML to WMZ (Compressed Windows Metafile)** is essential for generating **compressed vector graphics** from web pages. WMZ maintains the scalability and editability of vector graphics while significantly reducing file sizes, making it ideal for lightweight publishing, archival storage, and cross-platform sharing. By transforming HTML into WMZ, organizations can optimize performance, streamline distribution, and maintain high-quality visuals in a compact format.
