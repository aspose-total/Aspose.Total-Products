Converting an EPUB file to a PS file can be done in two easy steps. The first step is to render the EPUB file to a DOC file using the powerful Aspose.PDF for Java API. This API is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for document processing. Once the EPUB file has been rendered to a DOC file, the second step is to use the Aspose.Words for Java API to convert the DOC file to a PS file. This API is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package and provides a powerful set of features for document processing.

The Aspose.PDF for Java API provides a wide range of features for rendering EPUB files to DOC files. It supports a variety of formats, including EPUB, PDF, HTML, XPS, and more. It also provides a range of features for manipulating the content of the EPUB file, such as adding text, images, and tables.

The Aspose.Words for Java API provides a comprehensive set of features for converting DOC files to PS files. It supports a variety of formats, including DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML, and more. It also provides a range of features for manipulating the content of the DOC file, such as adding text, images, and tables.

By using the Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Words for Java APIs, you can easily convert an EPUB file to a PS file in two simple steps. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for document processing.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to PS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set PS as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected EPUB Document via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB to PS, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the EPUB using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.epub", "password");
// save EPUB as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PS Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to PS file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your PS to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.PS);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
