Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate PS to TSV conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process starts with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is a powerful PDF manipulation API that allows developers to render PS to XLSX. Once the PS file is converted to XLSX, the second step involves using Spreadsheet Programming API Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to TSV. 

Aspose.PDF for Java is a feature-rich API that enables developers to create, edit, manipulate, and convert PDF documents without any external dependencies. It provides a wide range of features such as document manipulation, text extraction, image extraction, form filling, and much more. It also supports rendering of PS files to XLSX, which is the first step in the PS to TSV conversion process. 

The second step in the PS to TSV conversion process is to use Aspose.Cells for Java. This Spreadsheet Programming API provides a wide range of features for working with spreadsheets such as creating, editing, and converting spreadsheets. It also supports converting XLSX to TSV, which is the second step in the PS to TSV conversion process. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate PS to TSV conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process starts with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render PS to XLSX. The second step involves using Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to TSV. This comprehensive suite of components provides developers with an easy and efficient way to integrate PS to TSV conversion feature into their Java applications.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to TSV format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your PS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TSV without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting PS file to TSV, you can also add watermark to your output TSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as TSV with Watermark.
