By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can integrate SVG to CSV conversion feature in your Java applications in two-step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) you can render SVG to XLSX. In the second step, you can convert XLSX to CSV by using Spreadsheet Programming API [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/).

2. Convert SVG to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to CSV format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

If your SVG document is password protected, you cannot convert it to CSV without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting SVG file to CSV, you can also add watermark to your output CSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as CSV with Watermark.
