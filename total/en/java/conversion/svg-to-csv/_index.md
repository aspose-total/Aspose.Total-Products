Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate powerful features into their Java applications. One of the features it provides is the ability to convert SVG to CSV. This can be achieved in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render the SVG to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow developers to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render SVG to XLSX, which is the first step in the conversion process. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert the XLSX to CSV. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with spreadsheets, including the ability to convert XLSX to CSV. It also provides a range of features for manipulating and creating spreadsheets, such as the ability to add formulas, insert images, and more. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate SVG to CSV conversion into their Java applications. The two-step process of using Aspose.PDF for Java to render SVG to XLSX and Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to CSV makes it easy to achieve this conversion.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to CSV format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your SVG document is password protected, you cannot convert it to CSV without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting SVG file to CSV, you can also add watermark to your output CSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as CSV with Watermark.
