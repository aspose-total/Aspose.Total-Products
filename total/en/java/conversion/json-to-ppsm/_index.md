Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert JSON format to PPSM within any Java application. This suite of APIs includes Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Slides for Java, which can be used to parse JSON to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPSM respectively.

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert JSON to PPSM in two simple steps. Firstly, Aspose.Cells for Java can be used to parse JSON to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating spreadsheets, including the ability to read and write various file formats, such as XLSX, XLS, ODS, CSV, HTML, and PDF. It also provides the ability to parse JSON to PPTX, allowing developers to quickly and easily convert JSON to PPTX.

Once the JSON has been parsed to PPTX, Aspose.Slides for Java can be used to convert PPTX to PPSM. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating presentations, including the ability to read and write various file formats, such as PPTX, PPT, ODP, PDF, and HTML. It also provides the ability to convert PPTX to PPSM, allowing developers to quickly and easily convert PPTX to PPSM.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert JSON to PPSM in two simple steps. This suite of APIs provides a wide range of features for manipulating spreadsheets and presentations, allowing developers to quickly and easily convert JSON to PPSM within any Java application.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPSM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to PPSM with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PPSM with Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPSM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPSM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPSM.
