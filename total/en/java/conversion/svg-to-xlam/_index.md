Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate various features into their Java applications. One of the features that can be integrated is the SVG to XLAM conversion feature. This feature can be implemented in two steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for Java to render SVG to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render SVG to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert SVG files into XLSX format. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to XLAM. Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert spreadsheets. It also provides the ability to convert XLSX to XLAM, allowing developers to easily convert XLSX files into XLAM format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate the SVG to XLAM conversion feature into their Java applications. The two-step process of using Aspose.PDF for Java to render SVG to XLSX and Aspose.Cells for Java to convert XLSX to XLAM makes it easy to implement this feature. With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily add this feature to their applications, allowing them to easily convert SVG files into XLAM format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected SVG to XLAM via Java" %}}
If your SVG document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLAM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert SVG File to XLAM with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting SVG file to XLAM, you can also add watermark to your output XLAM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLAM with Watermark.
