Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate XPS to CSV conversion feature in their Java applications. This two-step process begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java to render XPS to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents without any external dependencies. It provides a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, image extraction, document signing, and more.

Once the XPS document is converted to XLSX, the second step is to convert XLSX to CSV. This can be achieved by using Aspose.Cells for Java, a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets without any external dependencies. It provides a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, image extraction, document signing, and more. Aspose.Cells for Java also provides support for a variety of file formats such as XLSX, XLS, CSV, HTML, and more.

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate XPS to CSV conversion feature in their Java applications. Aspose.PDF for Java enables developers to render XPS to XLSX and Aspose.Cells for Java enables developers to convert XLSX to CSV. Both components are part of the Aspose.Total for Java suite, which provides a comprehensive set of components for developers to easily integrate various features in their Java applications.

If your XPS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to CSV without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting XPS file to CSV, you can also add watermark to your output CSV file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as CSV with Watermark.
