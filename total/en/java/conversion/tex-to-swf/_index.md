Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert TEX to SWF within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components provides a powerful set of tools for manipulating documents, images, and other file formats. 

The process of converting TEX to SWF begins with the use of Aspose.PDF for Java. This component allows developers to export TEX to PPTX, which is a PowerPoint presentation format. Once the TEX file has been converted to PPTX, Aspose.Slides for Java can be used to convert the PPTX to SWF. Aspose.Slides for Java is a PowerPoint Processing API that provides developers with the ability to create, modify, and convert PowerPoint presentations. 

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert TEX to SWF within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to export TEX to PPTX, and Aspose.Slides for Java is used to convert the PPTX to SWF. This suite of components provides a powerful set of tools for manipulating documents, images, and other file formats. With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert TEX to SWF with minimal effort.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

Document document = new Document("template.tex");
// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted TEX File via Java" %}}
While loading TEX file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open TEX document
Document doc = new Document("input.tex", "Your@Password");
// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save SWF File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting TEX to SWF, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);
