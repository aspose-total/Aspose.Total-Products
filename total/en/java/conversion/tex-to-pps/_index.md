Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert TEX to PPS within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. The process involves two steps, both of which are made simple by the use of Aspose.Total for Java. 

The first step is to export TEX to PPTX. This is done by using Aspose.PDF for Java, a powerful PDF Processing API. It allows developers to quickly and easily convert TEX to PPTX with just a few lines of code. It also provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to add, delete, and modify text, images, and other elements in the document. 

The second step is to convert PPTX to PPS. This is done by using Aspose.Slides for Java, a powerful PowerPoint Processing API. It provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to create, modify, and convert presentations. It also allows developers to quickly and easily convert PPTX to PPS with just a few lines of code. 

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for Java makes it easy to convert TEX to PPS within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. By using Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Slides for Java, developers can quickly and easily export TEX to PPTX and then convert PPTX to PPS with just a few lines of code.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Pps` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Format APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

```java

// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Pps format
presentation.save("output.pps", SaveFormat.Pps);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted TEX File via Java" %}}
While loading TEX file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open TEX document
Document doc = new Document("input.tex", "Your@Password");
// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PPS File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting TEX to PPS, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Pps format
presentation.save("output.pps", SaveFormat.Pps);
