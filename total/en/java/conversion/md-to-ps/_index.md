Converting a Markdown (MD) file to a PostScript (PS) file can be done in two easy steps using Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a suite of powerful document processing APIs that allow you to quickly and easily convert files from one format to another. 

The first step is to render the MD file to a DOC file using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables you to create, edit, and convert PDF files. It also allows you to render MD files to DOC files with ease. 

The second step is to convert the DOC file to a PS file using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables you to create, edit, and convert documents from one format to another. It also allows you to quickly and easily convert DOC files to PS files. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, you can easily and quickly convert MD files to PS files in two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for Java allows you to render MD files to DOC files, and Aspose.Words for Java allows you to convert DOC files to PS files. With Aspose.Total for Java, you can quickly and easily convert files from one format to another.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MD to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to PS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set PS as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected MD Document via Java" %}}
While converting MD to PS, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the MD using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.md", "password");
// save MD as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PS Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to PS file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your PS to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.PS);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
