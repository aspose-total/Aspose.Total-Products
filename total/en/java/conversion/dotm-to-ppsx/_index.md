Developers often need to convert DOTM files to PPSX programmatically. Fortunately, the process can be automated with the help of the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/). This library provides a simple and efficient way to render the conversion process. 

The first step is to load the DOTM file using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/). This library allows you to easily read and write Microsoft Word documents. Once the file is loaded, it can be converted to HTML. 

The next step is to use the powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) to create a new Presentation. This library provides a comprehensive set of features to create, modify, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations. You can use it to write HTML content into the presentation and save it as a PPSX file. 

By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/), developers can easily and quickly convert DOTM files to PPSX programmatically. The process involves loading the DOTM file with [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/), converting it to HTML, and then using [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) to create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPSX. This library provides a simple and efficient way to render the conversion process.

The API also allows you to convert password-protected DOTM documents to PPSX. If your input DOTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPSX format without using the password. In order to open a encrypted document you can set the correct password in LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.
