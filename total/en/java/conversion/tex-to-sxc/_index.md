Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate powerful file conversion features into their Java applications. It includes Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which can be used to convert TEX to SXC.

The process of converting TEX to SXC involves two steps. Firstly, Aspose.PDF for Java can be used to render TEX to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents in Java applications. It also supports the conversion of TEX to XLSX, allowing developers to easily convert TEX documents to XLSX format.

In the second step, Aspose.Cells for Java can be used to convert XLSX to SXC. This Spreadsheet Programming API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with spreadsheets in Java applications. It supports the conversion of XLSX to SXC, allowing developers to easily convert XLSX documents to SXC format.

Overall, Aspose.Total for Java provides a comprehensive set of APIs that enable developers to integrate powerful file conversion features into their Java applications. It includes Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which can be used to convert TEX to SXC in two-step process. By using these APIs, developers can easily convert TEX documents to SXC format in their Java applications.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to SXC format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

If your TEX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to SXC without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting TEX file to SXC, you can also add watermark to your output SXC file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as SXC with Watermark.
