Email conversion is a powerful feature that Java developers can integrate within any Java J2SE, J2EE, J2ME applications via [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/). By using two APIs within the package you can convert Email EMAIL to TEXT without any third party dependencies. Firstly, you can use Email Manipulation API [Aspose.Email for Java](https://products.aspose.com/email/java/) to convert EMAIL file format to HTML. Secondly, you can render HTML to TEXT by using Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/).

Converting emails to **plain text (.txt)** ensures that the essential content of messages is extracted in the simplest, most portable form. This format strips away unnecessary formatting, making the data lightweight, searchable, and highly compatible across platforms.
