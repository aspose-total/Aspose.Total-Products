[Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) File Format Automation libraries empower Java developers to automate the batch conversion process of PowerPoint PPSX to Word TEXT. Converting the document is a two-step process and involves using two APIs. Weâ€™ll use [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) that is a PowerPoint API for presentations manipulation and management to convert PPSX to HTML. After that by using feature-rich Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) we will convert the HTML to TEXT.
