Aspose.Total for Java is an all-in-one suite of components that enables developers to easily convert PostScript (PS) to Shockwave Flash (SWF) within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components is designed to make it easy for developers to quickly and efficiently convert PS to SWF with minimal effort.

The process of converting PS to SWF with Aspose.Total for Java is simple and straightforward. Firstly, the PS file is exported to a PowerPoint Presentation (PPTX) file using Aspose.PDF for Java. This component is a powerful PDF Processing API that enables developers to easily convert PS to PPTX.

Once the PS file has been converted to a PPTX file, Aspose.Slides for Java can be used to convert the PPTX file to SWF. Aspose.Slides for Java is a powerful PowerPoint Processing API that enables developers to quickly and easily convert PPTX to SWF.

With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert PS to SWF within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of components makes it easy for developers to quickly and efficiently convert PS to SWF with minimal effort.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

```java
// load PS file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.ps");
// save PS as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted PS File via Java" %}}
While loading PS file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open PS document
Document doc = new Document("input.ps", "Your@Password");
// save PS as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save SWF File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting PS to SWF, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);
