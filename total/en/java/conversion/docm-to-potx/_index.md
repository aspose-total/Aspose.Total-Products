Converting a DOCM file to POTX programmatically can be a daunting task for developers. Fortunately, the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) provide a simple and efficient solution. The process involves loading the DOCM file with [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) and converting it to HTML. Then, using the powerful PowerPoint manipulation Java API [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/), a new Presentation can be created, HTML content can be written in it, and it can be saved as POTX. 

The first step is to load the DOCM file with Aspose.Words for Java. This library provides a wide range of features for manipulating DOCM files, such as loading, saving, and converting them to other formats. Once the file is loaded, it can be converted to HTML using the Document.save method. This method allows developers to save the document in HTML format, which is necessary for the next step. 

The second step is to create a new Presentation with Aspose.Slides for Java. This library provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and manipulating PowerPoint presentations. Once the Presentation is created, the HTML content from the DOCM file can be written in it. Finally, the Presentation can be saved as POTX using the Presentation.save method. 

By using the File Automation Java libraries [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/), developers can easily convert DOCM files to POTX programmatically. The process involves loading the DOCM file with [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/), converting it to HTML, creating a new Presentation with [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/), writing HTML content in it, and saving it as POTX. This process is simple and efficient, and can be completed in a few simple steps.
