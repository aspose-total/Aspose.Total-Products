Converting CGM to DOTX is a simple two-step process that can be accomplished with the help of Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provide a wide range of features for document processing. The first step is to render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also allows developers to render CGM files to DOC format. After the CGM file is rendered to DOC, the second step is to convert the DOC file to DOTX using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert a wide range of document formats. It also allows developers to convert DOC files to DOTX format. With the help of these two APIs, developers can easily convert CGM to DOTX in a few simple steps.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOTX format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOTX as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to DOTX, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the ownerâ€™s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOTX Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOTX file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOTX to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement.
