Converting EPUB to PCL is a simple two-step process that can be accomplished using the powerful Document Processing API, Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provide developers with the tools they need to create, manipulate, and convert documents of all types. 

The first step in the conversion process is to render the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents with ease. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to render EPUB files to DOC. 

Once the EPUB file has been rendered to DOC, the second step is to convert the DOC to PCL using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents of all types. It provides a wide range of features, including the ability to convert DOC to PCL. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert EPUB to PCL in just two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render the EPUB file to DOC, and Aspose.Words for Java is used to convert the DOC to PCL. With Aspose.Total for Java, developers can quickly and easily convert EPUB to PCL with minimal effort.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to PCL format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set PCL as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected EPUB Document via Java" %}}
While converting EPUB to PCL, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the EPUB using the owner’s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PCL Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to PCL file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your PCL to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.PCL);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
