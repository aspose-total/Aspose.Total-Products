Converting SVG to ODT is a simple two-step process. To begin, you need to render the SVG file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF Processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. Once the SVG file has been rendered to DOC, you can then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to ODT. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful Document Processing API that is also part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. 

The first step in the conversion process is to render the SVG file to DOC. This can be done by using Aspose.PDF for Java. This API allows you to easily render the SVG file to DOC with just a few lines of code. Once the SVG file has been rendered to DOC, you can then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to ODT. Aspose.Words for Java provides a powerful set of features that make it easy to convert DOC to ODT. 

In conclusion, converting SVG to ODT is a simple two-step process. First, you need to render the SVG file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Then, you can use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to ODT. Both of these APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, making it easy to convert SVG to ODT.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to ODT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set ODT as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Manipulation APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

// save SVG as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.ODT
outputDocument.save("output.odt", SaveFormat.ODT);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected SVG Document via Java" %}}
While converting SVG to ODT, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the SVG using the owner’s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.svg", "password");
// save SVG as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save ODT Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to ODT file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your ODT to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.ODT);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
