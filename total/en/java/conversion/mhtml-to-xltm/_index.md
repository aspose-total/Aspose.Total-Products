By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can integrate MHTML to XLTM conversion feature in your Java applications in two-step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) you can render MHTML to XLSX. In the second step, you can convert XLSX to XLTM by using Spreadsheet Programming API [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected MHTML to XLTM via Java" %}}
If your MHTML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert MHTML File to XLTM with Watermark via Java" %}}
While converting MHTML file to XLTM, you can also add watermark to your output XLTM file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLTM with Watermark.
