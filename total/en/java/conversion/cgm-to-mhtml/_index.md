Converting CGM to MHTML is a simple two-step process that can be accomplished with the help of Aspose.Total for Java. Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provide powerful document processing capabilities. 

The first step in the conversion process is to render the CGM file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to render CGM files to DOC. 

Once the CGM file has been rendered to DOC, the second step is to convert the DOC to MHTML using Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words for Java is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents. It provides the ability to convert DOC files to MHTML. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert CGM to MHTML in just two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render the CGM file to DOC, and Aspose.Words for Java is used to convert the DOC to MHTML. This makes it easy to convert CGM to MHTML without any hassle.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to MHTML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set MHTML as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to MHTML, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the owner’s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MHTML Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to MHTML file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your MHTML to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement.

Converting **Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)** files to **MHTML (MIME HTML)** format is essential for preserving complex engineering and technical documents with embedded graphics in a single, self-contained file. In **Java-based web archiving systems**, this conversion allows organizations to store complete documents—including CGM visuals, styles, and resources—within a portable archive suitable for offline viewing and intranet deployment. MHTML ensures that design specifications, reports, and drawings remain intact for long-term accessibility and distribution.
