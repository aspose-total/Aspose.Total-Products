Converting MD to XAMLFLOW is a simple two-step process. To begin, you need to render the MD file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Java. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful document processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to quickly and easily convert MD files to DOC format.

Once the MD file has been rendered to DOC, you can then use Aspose.Words for Java to convert the DOC to XAMLFLOW. Aspose.Words for Java is another powerful document processing API that is part of the Aspose.Total for Java package. This API allows you to quickly and easily convert DOC files to XAMLFLOW format.

By using these two APIs, you can easily and quickly convert MD to XAMLFLOW. Aspose.PDF for Java allows you to render the MD file to DOC, and Aspose.Words for Java allows you to convert the DOC to XAMLFLOW. Both of these APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for Java package, making it easy to access and use them. With these two simple steps, you can quickly and easily convert MD to XAMLFLOW.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MD to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to XAML_FLOW format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set XAML_FLOW as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.XAML_FLOW
outputDocument.save("output.xaml_flow", SaveFormat.XAML_FLOW);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected MD Document via Java" %}}
While converting MD to XAMLFLOW, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the MD using the ownerâ€™s password. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open encrypted document
Document document = new Document("input.md", "password");
// save MD as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XAMLFLOW Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to XAMLFLOW file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your XAMLFLOW to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
public static void StoreToDatabase(Document doc, Connection mConnection) throws Exception {
    // create an output stream which uses byte array to save data
    ByteArrayOutputStream aout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    // save the document to byte array
    doc.save(aout, SaveFormat.XAML_FLOW);
    // get the byte array from output steam
    // the byte array now contains the document
    byte[] buffer = aout.toByteArray();
    // get the filename from the document.
    String fileName = doc.getOriginalFileName();
    String filePath = fileName.replace("\\", "\\\\");
    // create the SQL command.
    String commandString = "INSERT INTO Documents (FileName, FileContent) VALUES('" + filePath + "', '" + buffer + "')";
    Statement statement = mConnection.createStatement();
    statement.executeUpdate(commandString);
}
