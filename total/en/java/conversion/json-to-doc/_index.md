Converting JSON to DOC format through Java can provide several benefits, such as enhancing compatibility between different systems and applications, since DOC is a widely used document format. Additionally, developers can customize the conversion process and output according to specific requirements, thus providing a high degree of flexibility.
Another benefit is that converting JSON to DOC format can help to improve data representation. This is because JSON is a lightweight data format, and converting it to DOC can provide a more visually appealing and user-friendly representation of the data. Furthermore, this conversion can make the data more accessible to non-technical users as Microsoft Word is a widely used application.

Aspose.Total for Java provides a comprehensive solution for converting JSON to DOC format. It offers a two-step process for converting JSON to DOC in your own Java applications.

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON while parsing JSON to DOC using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also parse JSON to DOC with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your DOC document, you can first convert the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions.
