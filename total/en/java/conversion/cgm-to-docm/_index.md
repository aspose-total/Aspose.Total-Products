{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected CGM Document via Java" %}}
While converting CGM to DOCM, even if your document is password protected, you can still open it using PDF Manipulation API [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/). In order to open the encrypted file, you need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object and open the CGM using the ownerâ€™s password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DOCM Document to a Database via Java" %}}
While saving your input document to DOCM file format, you can also save your document to database instead of a file system. You may need to implement storing and retrieving Document objects to and from a database. This would be necessary if you were implementing any type of content management system. In order to save your DOCM to database it is often necessary to serialize the document to obtain a byte array. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/Java/) API. After getting your byte array, you can store it in the database using SQL statement.
