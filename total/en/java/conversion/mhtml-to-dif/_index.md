Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate MHTML to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java, which are two powerful APIs that allow developers to render MHTML to XLSX and convert XLSX to DIF respectively. 

The process of converting MHTML to DIF involves two steps. In the first step, Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render MHTML to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents in their Java applications. It also supports a variety of other file formats, including HTML, MHTML, XPS, and EPUB. 

In the second step, Aspose.Cells for Java is used to convert XLSX to DIF. This Spreadsheet Programming API provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in their Java applications. It supports a variety of file formats, including XLSX, XLS, CSV, ODS, and HTML. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate MHTML to DIF conversion feature in their Java applications. This suite provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to render MHTML to XLSX and convert XLSX to DIF in two-step process. Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Cells for Java are two powerful APIs that make it easy for developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents and spreadsheets in their Java applications.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MHTML to XLSX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to DIF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

If your MHTML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting MHTML file to DIF, you can also add watermark to your output DIF file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as DIF with Watermark.
