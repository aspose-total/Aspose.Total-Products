Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily integrate PS to XLT conversion feature into their Java applications. This two-step process begins with Aspose.PDF for Java, which is used to render PS to XLSX. Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their Java applications. It also provides features such as document splitting, merging, and page extraction. 

Once the PS file has been converted to XLSX, the second step of the process is to convert XLSX to XLT using Aspose.Cells for Java. Aspose.Cells for Java is a Spreadsheet Programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets from within their Java applications. It provides features such as creating and editing worksheets, formatting cells, and applying formulas. It also supports a wide range of spreadsheet formats, including XLSX, XLT, and XLS. 

By using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily integrate PS to XLT conversion feature into their Java applications. Aspose.PDF for Java is used to render PS to XLSX, and Aspose.Cells for Java is used to convert XLSX to XLT. This two-step process enables developers to quickly and easily convert PS files to XLT format.

If your PS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLT without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.

While converting PS file to XLT, you can also add watermark to your output XLT file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted XLSX file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLT with Watermark.
