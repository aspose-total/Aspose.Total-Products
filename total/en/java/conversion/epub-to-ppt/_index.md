Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert EPUB to PPT within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. The process involves two steps, both of which are made simple by the components included in Aspose.Total for Java.

The first step is to export the EPUB file to PPTX format. This is done using Aspose.PDF for Java, a powerful PDF Processing API that enables developers to manipulate PDF documents in a variety of ways. With Aspose.PDF for Java, developers can easily convert EPUB to PPTX with just a few lines of code.

The second step is to convert the PPTX file to PPT format. This is done using Aspose.Slides for Java, a powerful PowerPoint Processing API that enables developers to manipulate PowerPoint presentations in a variety of ways. With Aspose.Slides for Java, developers can easily convert PPTX to PPT with just a few lines of code.

In summary, Aspose.Total for Java makes it easy for developers to convert EPUB to PPT within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. By using Aspose.PDF for Java to export the EPUB file to PPTX format, and then using Aspose.Slides for Java to convert the PPTX file to PPT format, developers can quickly and easily convert EPUB to PPT with just a few lines of code.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Ppt` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Java File Format APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java/) based project and include [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/java/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/installation/) in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/java).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted EPUB File via Java" %}}
While loading EPUB file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("input.epub", "Your@Password");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save PPT File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting EPUB to PPT, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Ppt format
presentation.save("output.ppt", SaveFormat.Ppt);
