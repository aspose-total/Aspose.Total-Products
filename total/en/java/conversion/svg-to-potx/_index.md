Aspose.Total for Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert SVG to POTX within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of APIs provides a powerful and efficient way to convert SVG to POTX without any manual intervention. 

The process of converting SVG to POTX involves two steps. Firstly, Aspose.PDF for Java can be used to export SVG to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents. It also provides the ability to export SVG to PPTX, which is the first step in the conversion process. 

Once the SVG has been exported to PPTX, Aspose.Slides for Java can be used to convert PPTX to POTX. This PowerPoint Processing API provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, edit, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations. It also provides the ability to convert PPTX to POTX, which is the second step in the conversion process. 

Using Aspose.Total for Java, developers can easily convert SVG to POTX within any Java J2SE, J2EE, or J2ME application. This suite of APIs provides a powerful and efficient way to convert SVG to POTX without any manual intervention. It is a great tool for developers who need to quickly and easily convert SVG to POTX.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Potx` as SaveFormat

// save SVG as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Potx format
presentation.save("output.potx", SaveFormat.Potx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Encrypted SVG File via Java" %}}
While loading SVG file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open SVG document
Document doc = new Document("input.svg", "Your@Password");
// save SVG as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save POTX File with Predefined View Type via Java" %}}
After converting SVG to POTX, you can also add predefined view type for your presentation. [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) provides a facility to set the view type for the generated presentation when it is opened in PowerPoint through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties) class. The [setLastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewProperties#setLastView-int-) property is used to set the view type by using the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ViewType) enumerator.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// set view type
presentation.getViewProperties().setLastView((byte) ViewType.SlideMasterView);
// save the presentation as Potx format
presentation.save("output.potx", SaveFormat.Potx);
