We use [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/), a child API of [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) designed for particular document manipulation features as well as tasks associated with retrieving and searching document content. Below code performs text search and replacements within an Excel workbook. It begins by loading an Excel file into a Workbook object. The code sets up replacement options using the ReplaceOptions class, specifying that the replacements should be case-insensitive and that partial cell content matches are allowed. It then initiates the text replacement process by invoking the replace method on the Workbook object. Furthermore, it enables regular expression matching by setting the regexKey to true, and replaces occurrences of the defined word. Finally, the updated workbook is saved. Moreover, Java Search API also supports PDF, Microsoft [PowerPoint document search](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/search/pptx/) and other formats as well.
