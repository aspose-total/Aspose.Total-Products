Document redaction is the critical process of editing a document to eliminate or obscure sensitive information, ensuring that specific sections are no longer visible or readable. Widely applied in legal, government, healthcare, and corporate sectors, this practice safeguards confidential data from unauthorized access or disclosure.<br /><br />

This meticulous process involves the careful removal or obscuring of sensitive elements like text, images, or metadata to protect privacy, confidentiality, or compliance with regulations. Whether executed manually or through automated methods, document redaction faces challenges in achieving complete removal, consistency, and maintaining overall document integrity. The goal is to strike a delicate balance, ensuring that redaction efforts successfully preserve the confidentiality and security of the document's content.
