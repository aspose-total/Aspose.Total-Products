Redacting PDF files using Java APIs is a cornerstone for protecting universally shared documents. Automated redaction removes client names, hides medical histories, and masks SSNs in tax forms with high precision.

## ✅ Key Use Cases

- **Contracts:** Eliminate client details from legal PDFs.
- **Healthcare Docs:** Redact patient histories for compliance.
- **Tax Forms:** Mask Social Security Numbers in financial submissions.

## ⚙️ Automation Scenarios

- **GDPR/HIPAA Compliance:** Enforce privacy policies at scale.
- **Secure Exchange:** Share sanitized PDFs safely with third parties.
- **E-Discovery:** Automate redaction for FOIA or litigation processes.
