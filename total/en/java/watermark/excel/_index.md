Applying watermarks to EXCEL files using Java APIs is crucial for protecting sensitive spreadsheets, ensuring branding consistency, and deterring unauthorized use. Programmatic watermarking helps organizations add “Internal Use Only” or brand elements across financial data.

#### ✅ Key Use Cases

- **Watermark Sensitive Sheets** — Mark confidential spreadsheets with usage labels.
- **Brand Dashboards** — Embed company logos in performance dashboards.
- **Prevent Data Misuse** — Signal proprietary ownership on shared EXCEL files.

#### ⚙️ Automation Scenarios

- **Financial Reporting Pipelines** — Auto-watermark spreadsheets during report generation.
- **Audit Workflows** — Add compliance labels in audit-ready EXCEL files.
- **Budget Distribution** — Mark internal budgets to control external sharing.
