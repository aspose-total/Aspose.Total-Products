<h2> üìù Why Annotate TXT Files: Streamline Log Analysis, Documentation & Data Reviews</h2>

Annotating **TXT (plain-text)** files is essential for teams handling raw data, technical notes, and log files. Adding comments, highlights, or inline notes improves collaboration, clarifies context, and makes plain-text files more actionable for technical and analytical tasks.

## ‚úÖ Key Use Cases

- **Log Analysis:** Annotate server logs, error reports, or event records to flag issues, add explanations, and track fixes.
- **Plain-Text Documentation:** Use comments to clarify instructions, update configuration notes, or guide team edits in readme and config files.
- **Source Data Reviews:** Mark up raw datasets, transcripts, or code snippets to highlight anomalies or suggest changes before processing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Benefits

- **AI Preprocessing:** Automate annotations to tag key data points, detect patterns, and prepare plain-text files for further analysis.
- **Code Reviews:** Add inline comments to source code stored in TXT files to streamline reviews and track revisions.
- **Technical Documentation:** Use automated tools to generate or update annotations in plain-text manuals and reference notes.
