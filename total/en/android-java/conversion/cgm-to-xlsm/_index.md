<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. XLSM (Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook) is a Microsoft Excel Open XML Format Spreadsheet file that supports macros. It is used to store data in a tabular format and is widely used for data analysis and reporting. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to XLSM in order to use the data in Excel.
