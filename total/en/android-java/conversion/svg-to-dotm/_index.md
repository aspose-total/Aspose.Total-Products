<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector image format that is widely used in web design and other applications. It is an XML-based format that is used to define vector-based graphics for the web. On the other hand, DOTM (Microsoft Office Open XML Macro-Enabled Template) is a template file format used by Microsoft Word. It is used to store documents with macros and other settings. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to DOTM in order to use the SVG image in a Microsoft Word document.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for svg to dotm conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate various features into mobile applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert SVG to DOTM. The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert SVG to DOC. The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC to DOTM. By using these two APIs, you can easily integrate SVG to DOTM conversion feature in your mobile apps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get SVG File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting SVG to DOTM, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a SVG file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load SVG document
Document doc = new Document("template.svg");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOTM document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOTM document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.DOTM);
