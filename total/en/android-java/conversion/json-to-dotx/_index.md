<h2>Why to Convert JSON to DOTX?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between different applications. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write. DOTX is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a template file that contains text, formatting, and other document elements. Converting JSON to DOTX allows users to create documents from JSON data and use them in Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to DOTX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a suite of APIs that can be used to convert JSON to DOTX. It includes two powerful APIs: Aspose.Cells for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android via Java. Aspose.Cells for Android via Java is a powerful spreadsheet processing API that can be used to parse JSON to PDF. Aspose.Words for Android via Java is a Word Processing API that can be used to convert PDF to DOTX. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for Android via Java product family. With the help of these APIs, users can easily convert JSON to DOTX in their Android applications in a two-step process.

2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to DOTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON format while parsing JSON to DOTX using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to DOTX with Watermark in Android Apps" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to DOTX with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your DOTX document, you can first parse the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to DOTX.
