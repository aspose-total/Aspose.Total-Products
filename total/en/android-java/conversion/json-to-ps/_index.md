<h2>Why to Convert JSON to PS?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format and is easy for humans to read and write. On the other hand, PostScript (PS) is a page description language used mainly in the electronic and desktop publishing areas for defining the contents and layout of documents. It is a vector-based language and is used to describe the appearance of text, graphics, and images. Therefore, it is important to convert JSON to PS in order to make the data more accessible and easier to use.
