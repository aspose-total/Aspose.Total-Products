<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. XLSX (Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet) is a file format used for storing and exchanging data. It is the default format used by Microsoft Excel. XLT (Microsoft Excel Template) is a file format used for creating new spreadsheets. It is a template that contains formatting and formulas that can be used to create new spreadsheets.
