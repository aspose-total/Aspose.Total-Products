<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOTX format is a Microsoft Word template file that is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is a great way to ensure that all documents created from the template have the same formatting and layout. However, the DOTX format is not compatible with other applications, such as spreadsheets. Therefore, it is necessary to convert DOTX to a more widely accepted format, such as ODS, in order to use the data in other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOTX to ODS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to integrate document manipulation and conversion features into their Android applications. With Aspose.Total, developers can easily convert DOTX to ODS. The process involves two steps: first, converting the DOTX to HTML using the feature-rich Aspose.Words for Android via Java API, and then converting the HTML to ODS using the Aspose.Cells for Java API. This process is quick and easy, and it ensures that the data is accurately converted from DOTX to ODS.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Remove Unused Information from a DOTX Document in Android Apps" %}}
Before converting DOTX to ODS, you can remove unused information from DOTX Document via [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/). Sometimes you may need to remove unused or duplicate information to reduce the size of the output document and processing time. The [CleanupOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/CleanupOptions) class allows you to specify options for document cleaning. To remove duplicate styles or just unused styles or lists from the document, you can use the [Cleanup](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#cleanup()) method. You can use the [UnusedStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedStyles) and [UnusedBuiltinStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedBuiltinStyles) properties to detect and remove styles that are marked as “unused”.
