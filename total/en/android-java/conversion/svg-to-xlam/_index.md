<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format is a widely used vector image format, which is used to create and display images on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. On the other hand, XLAM (Excel Add-in) is a file format used by Microsoft Excel to store macros, user-defined functions, and various command sets. It is used to extend the functionality of Excel. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to XLAM in order to use the images in Excel.
