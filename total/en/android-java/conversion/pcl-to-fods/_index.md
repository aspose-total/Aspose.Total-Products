<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is supported by most operating systems. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing or manipulating data. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF files to other formats such as Microsoft Excel (XLSX) or OpenDocument Spreadsheet (FODS) in order to edit and manipulate the data.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to FODS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate PCL to FODS conversion feature within their Android applications. The suite consists of two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. 

Using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, developers can easily convert PCL to XLSX. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to convert PCL to XLSX. It also supports a variety of other features such as document manipulation, text extraction, and image extraction.

Once the PCL file has been converted to XLSX, developers can use Aspose.Cells for Android via Java to convert the XLSX file to FODS. This powerful spreadsheet processing API provides a wide range of features for manipulating spreadsheets, including the ability to convert XLSX to FODS.
