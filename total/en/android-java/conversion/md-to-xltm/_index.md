<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert Markdown (MD) to Excel Template (XLTM) files is becoming increasingly common as more and more businesses are using spreadsheets to store and analyze data.

Converting MD to XLTM allows users to easily view and manipulate the data in a spreadsheet format.
