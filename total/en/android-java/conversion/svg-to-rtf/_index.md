<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web graphics, and is supported by most web browsers. On the other hand, RTF (Rich Text Format) is a document file format used by Microsoft products, such as Word and Office. It is used to store formatted text and graphics, and is supported by most word processors. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to RTF in order to make it compatible with Microsoft products.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for svg to rtf conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents in various formats. It includes two APIs that can be used to integrate SVG to RTF conversion feature in mobile apps. 

The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert SVG file to DOC. This API provides a wide range of features, such as creating, editing, and converting PDF documents. It also supports various image formats, including SVG.

The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC to RTF. This API provides a wide range of features, such as creating, editing, and converting documents. It also supports various document formats, including RTF.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate SVG to RTF conversion feature in their mobile apps. This feature can be used to make SVG files compatible with Microsoft products, such as Word and Office.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get SVG File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting SVG to RTF, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a SVG file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load SVG document
Document doc = new Document("template.svg");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in RTF document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a RTF document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.rtf", SaveFormat.RTF);  
```
