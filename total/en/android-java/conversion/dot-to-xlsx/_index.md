<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOT file format is a text-based file format used for storing graphical diagrams. It is used by a variety of programs, including Microsoft Visio, yEd, and Dia. However, the DOT file format is not supported by many programs, making it difficult to share diagrams with others. Converting DOT to XLSX is a great way to make diagrams more accessible and shareable.
