<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Presentation Slide Show (PPSM) file format is a presentation file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is used to store presentations in a compressed format. However, the XLSX file format is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file format used for storing and exchanging data. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PPSM files to XLSX in order to access the data stored in the PPSM file.
