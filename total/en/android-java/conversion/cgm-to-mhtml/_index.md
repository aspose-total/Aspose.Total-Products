<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used for saving web pages in a single file. It is used for archiving web pages and sending them as email attachments. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to MHTML in order to make the data more accessible.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for cgm to mhtml conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a suite of APIs that provides developers with the ability to integrate CGM to MHTML conversion feature in their mobile apps. It includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API allows developers to convert CGM files to DOC format. It supports a wide range of file formats, including CGM, PDF, DOC, DOCX, HTML, XPS, and many more. It also provides features such as document manipulation, text extraction, and image extraction.

The Aspose.Words for Android Java API enables developers to render DOC files to MHTML. It supports a wide range of file formats, including DOC, DOCX, HTML, MHTML, ODT, RTF, and many more. It also provides features such as document manipulation, text extraction, and image extraction.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate CGM to MHTML conversion feature in their mobile apps. This will enable them to make their data more accessible and easier to share.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to MHTML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set MHTML as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get CGM File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting CGM to MHTML, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a CGM file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load CGM document
Document doc = new Document("template.cgm");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in MHTML document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a MHTML document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.mhtml", SaveFormat.MHTML);
