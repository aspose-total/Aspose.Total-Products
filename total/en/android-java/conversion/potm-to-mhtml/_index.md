<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Office Template Master (POTM) file format is a Microsoft Office file format used to store templates for Microsoft Office applications. It is used to store templates for Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The MHTML (MIME HTML) file format is a web page archive format used to store HTML documents and their associated resources, such as images, audio, and video files. It is used to store web pages and other web-based documents. Converting a POTM file to MHTML can be useful for sharing documents with others, as MHTML is a widely supported format.
