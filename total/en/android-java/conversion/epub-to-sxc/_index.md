<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not compatible with the SXC format, which is used for spreadsheets. Therefore, if you want to use the data from an EPUB file in a spreadsheet, you need to convert it to SXC.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to SXC Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a powerful suite of APIs that can help you integrate EPUB to SXC conversion feature within your android applications. It consists of two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Cells for Android via Java.
