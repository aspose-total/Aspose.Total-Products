<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The PostScript (PS) format is a page description language used mainly in desktop publishing applications. It is a vector-based language that describes the appearance of a printed page. The Data Interchange Format (DIF) is a data file format used to exchange data between different spreadsheet applications. It is a tabular format that stores data in rows and columns. Converting PS to DIF allows users to access the data stored in PS files in a spreadsheet application.
