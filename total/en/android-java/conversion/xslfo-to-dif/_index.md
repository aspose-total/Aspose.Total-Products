<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML document formatting which is used to define the layout of a document. It is used to describe page layout for a variety of output devices. On the other hand, DIF (Data Interchange Format) is a text-based file format used to exchange data between different spreadsheet applications. It is used to transfer data between different programs that are not compatible with each other. Therefore, it is necessary to convert XSLFO to DIF in order to exchange data between different spreadsheet applications.
