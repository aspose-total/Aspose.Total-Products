<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format, which is based on XML. It is used to define vector-based graphics for the web. On the other hand, the Data Interchange Format (DIF) is a text-based file format used to exchange data between different spreadsheet applications. It is used to store data in a tabular form. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to DIF in order to use the data in different spreadsheet applications.
