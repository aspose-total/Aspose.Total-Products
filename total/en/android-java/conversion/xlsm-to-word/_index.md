                          <span itemprop="text">Online App for XLSM conversion is integrated above. To begin the XLSM to WORD conversion process, the first step is to import your XLSM file. This can be done in two ways: you can either drag and drop the XLSM file into the conversion tool, or you can click inside the white area of the tool to browse your computer and select the XLSM file you wish to convert. Once you have successfully imported the XLSM file, you'll need to click the Convert button to start the conversion process. <br />
During the conversion process, the XLSM file will be transformed into a WORD file. The conversion tool will work its magic, and when the process is completed, you will be able to download your newly converted WORD file. This means you can easily get output WORD files with just one click, without the need for any complicated software or technical knowledge.</span>

                          <span itemprop="text">One of the key features of this online XLSM to WORD converter is its fast conversion speed. However, the speed of the conversion process is primarily dependent on the size of the XLSM file that you wish to convert. If you are working with a small size XLSM file, you can expect the conversion process to be completed in just a few seconds.<br />

In addition, if you have integrated the conversion code within a Android App application, the speed of the conversion process will depend on how you have optimized your application. If your application is well-optimized and has been designed to handle the conversion process efficiently, then the conversion speed will be faster. On the other hand, if your application is not optimized for this purpose, the conversion process may take longer to complete.</span>

We understand that your files contain sensitive and personal information, which is why we have implemented several measures to ensure that your files are safe and secure.<br />

Firstly, we automatically delete all uploaded files after 24 hours. This means that once the conversion process is complete and you have downloaded your converted file, we will delete the original XLSM file and the resulting WORD file from our servers. Additionally, the download links for your files will stop working after 24 hours, ensuring that your files are not accessible to anyone after this time period.<br />

We also take steps to ensure that your files are protected from unauthorized access. No one has access to your files during or after the conversion process, and all data transmission between your computer and our servers is encrypted and secure.</span>
