<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to PPSX?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save web pages in a single file. It is a combination of HTML code and resources like images, audio, and video. It is used to save webpages for offline viewing. On the other hand, PPSX is a PowerPoint presentation file format used to save presentations created in Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of PPTX file format and is used to save presentations in a smaller size. Therefore, it is necessary to convert MHTML to PPSX in order to view the webpages offline in a presentation format.
