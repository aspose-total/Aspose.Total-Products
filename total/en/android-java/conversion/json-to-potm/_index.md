<h2>Why to Convert JSON to POTM?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between different applications. It is a text-based format that is easy to read and write. On the other hand, POTM (Presentation Open XML Macro-Enabled) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations that contain macros. It is a binary file format that is used to store presentations with macros. Therefore, it is necessary to convert JSON to POTM in order to use the data in PowerPoint presentations.

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to POTM with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to POTM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POTM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to POTM.
