<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert PostScript (PS) files to WordML (Word Markup Language) is becoming increasingly common. PS files are used to store documents in a format that is compatible with a wide range of printers and other devices, while WordML is a markup language used to create documents in Microsoft Word. Converting PS files to WordML allows users to access and edit documents in a format that is compatible with Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to WordML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate PS to WORDML conversion feature into mobile apps. The package includes two APIs that can be used to convert PS files to WordML. The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert PS files to DOC. The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC to WORDML. By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate PS to WORDML conversion feature into their mobile apps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PS to WORDML, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load PS document
Document doc = new Document("template.ps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in WORDML document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a WORDML document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.word_ml", SaveFormat.WORD_ML);
