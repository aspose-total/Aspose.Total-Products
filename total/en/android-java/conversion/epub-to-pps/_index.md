<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not compatible with PowerPoint presentations. To make an EPUB file compatible with PowerPoint, it must be converted to the PPS format. This allows the user to view the EPUB file in a PowerPoint presentation, which can be shared with others.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.pps");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
