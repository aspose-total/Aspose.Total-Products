<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The TEX format is a plain text format used for typesetting documents. It is a popular format for writing scientific and technical documents. However, it is not suitable for data analysis and manipulation. Therefore, it is necessary to convert TEX to a more suitable format such as CSV.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to CSV Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate document processing features into their Android applications. It includes two powerful APIs, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Cells for Android via Java, which can be used to convert TEX to CSV.

The first step in the process is to convert TEX to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a wide range of features for working with PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF files to other formats such as XLSX.

The second step is to convert XLSX to CSV using Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with spreadsheets, including the ability to convert XLSX files to other formats such as CSV.

Both APIs are easy to use and can be integrated into any Android application with minimal effort. They also provide a range of features for working with documents, making them ideal for any application that requires document processing capabilities.
