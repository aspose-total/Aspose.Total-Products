<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application used to create them. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing or modifying the content of the document. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the PDF file to a format that can be edited, such as Microsoft Word's DOTX format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for PCL to DOTX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate various features into mobile applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert PCL files to DOTX format. The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert PCL files to DOC format. The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render the DOC file to DOTX format. This process can be used to integrate PCL to DOTX conversion feature in mobile applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PCL File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PCL to DOTX, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PCL file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load PCL document
Document doc = new Document("template.pcl");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Insert Endnotes in DOTX Document in Android via Java" %}}
Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOTX document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOTX document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dotx", SaveFormat.DOTX);
