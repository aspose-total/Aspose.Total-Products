<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Markdown (MD) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. On the other hand, Data Interchange Format (DIF) is a text-based data interchange format used to exchange data between different applications. It is a tabular format that stores data in rows and columns. Therefore, it is necessary to convert MD to DIF in order to exchange data between different applications.
