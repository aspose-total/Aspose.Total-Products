Are you an Android developer looking to add a document conversion feature to your application? [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) File Format Automation libraries can help you automate the document conversion process in your Android applications. In order to convert WORD file to PPT, you can first use document manipulation API [Aspose.Words for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) to convert WORD file format to HTML. After that by using PowerPoint API [Aspose.Slides for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPT.

You can also convert your password-protected WORD to PPT within your Android applications. If your input WORD document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPT format without using the password. In order to open an encrypted document, you can set the correct password in the LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.

Within your Android applications, the API also allows you to perform WORD file to PPT conversion with watermark. 
In order to add a watermark to your PPT document, you can first export WORD to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPT.
