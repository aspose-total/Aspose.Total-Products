<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TEX to FLATOPC conversion is a necessary step for mobile app developers who want to integrate the feature into their apps. FLATOPC is a file format that is used to store documents in a compressed form, making them easier to store and share. By converting TEX files to FLATOPC, mobile app developers can ensure that their apps are able to store and share documents in a more efficient manner.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to FLATOPC Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a package that provides two APIs that can be used to convert TEX files to FLATOPC. The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert TEX files to DOC. The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC to FLATOPC. By using these two APIs, mobile app developers can easily integrate TEX to FLATOPC conversion feature into their apps.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to FLAT_OPC format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set FLAT_OPC as SaveFormat

// save TEX as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.FLAT_OPC
outputDocument.save("output.flat_opc", SaveFormat.FLAT_OPC);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get TEX File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting TEX to FLATOPC, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a TEX file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load TEX document
Document doc = new Document("template.tex");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Insert Endnotes in FLATOPC Document in Android via Java" %}}
Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in FLATOPC document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a FLATOPC document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.flat_opc", SaveFormat.FLAT_OPC);
