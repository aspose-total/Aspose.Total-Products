<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to PPT</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, and is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format that is supported by many e-book readers, including Apple's iBooks, Barnes & Noble's Nook, and Amazon's Kindle. However, the EPUB format is not supported by Microsoft PowerPoint, which is the most popular presentation software. Therefore, if you want to include content from an EPUB file in a PowerPoint presentation, you need to convert the EPUB file to the PPT format.
