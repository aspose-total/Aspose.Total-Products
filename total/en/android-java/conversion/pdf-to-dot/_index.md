<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

PDF to DOT conversion is a useful feature for mobile apps. It allows users to convert PDF documents to DOT format, which is a text-based file format used for creating diagrams and graphs. This conversion is useful for creating visual representations of data, such as charts and graphs, which can be used in presentations, reports, and other documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PDF to DOT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate PDF to DOT conversion feature in mobile apps. It includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. The first API is used to convert PDF files to DOC format, while the second API is used to render DOC to DOT. This makes it easy to integrate PDF to DOT conversion feature in mobile apps. The APIs are easy to use and can be integrated quickly and easily into any mobile app.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PDF File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PDF to DOT, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PDF file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load PDF document
Document doc = new Document("template.pdf");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOT document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOT document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dot", SaveFormat.DOT);
