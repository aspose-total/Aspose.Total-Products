<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting Excel to PowerPoint is a common requirement for many businesses. Excel is a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation, but it is not ideal for presenting data to an audience. PowerPoint, on the other hand, is designed to create visually appealing presentations. By converting Excel to PowerPoint, businesses can present their data in a more engaging and professional way.

                          <span itemprop="text">Online App for EXCEL conversion is integrated above. To begin the EXCEL to PPTX conversion process, the first step is to import your EXCEL file. This can be done in two ways: you can either drag and drop the EXCEL file into the conversion tool, or you can click inside the white area of the tool to browse your computer and select the EXCEL file you wish to convert. Once you have successfully imported the EXCEL file, you'll need to click the Convert button to start the conversion process. <br />
During the conversion process, the EXCEL file will be transformed into a PPTX file. The conversion tool will work its magic, and when the process is completed, you will be able to download your newly converted PPTX file. This means you can easily get output PPTX files with just one click, without the need for any complicated software or technical knowledge.</span>

                          <span itemprop="text">One of the key features of this online EXCEL to PPTX converter is its fast conversion speed. However, the speed of the conversion process is primarily dependent on the size of the EXCEL file that you wish to convert. If you are working with a small size EXCEL file, you can expect the conversion process to be completed in just a few seconds.<br />

In addition, if you have integrated the conversion code within a Android App application, the speed of the conversion process will depend on how you have optimized your application. If your application is well-optimized and has been designed to handle the conversion process efficiently, then the conversion speed will be faster. On the other hand, if your application is not optimized for this purpose, the conversion process may take longer to complete.</span>

We understand that your files contain sensitive and personal information, which is why we have implemented several measures to ensure that your files are safe and secure.<br />

Firstly, we automatically delete all uploaded files after 24 hours. This means that once the conversion process is complete and you have downloaded your converted file, we will delete the original EXCEL file and the resulting PPTX file from our servers. Additionally, the download links for your files will stop working after 24 hours, ensuring that your files are not accessible to anyone after this time period.<br />

We also take steps to ensure that your files are protected from unauthorized access. No one has access to your files during or after the conversion process, and all data transmission between your computer and our servers is encrypted and secure.</span>
