<h2>Why to Convert XML to SWF</h2>

XML to SWF conversion is a useful process for Android application developers. SWF is a file format used for multimedia, vector graphics, and ActionScript. It is used to create interactive animations, games, and other applications. XML is a markup language used to store and transport data. By converting XML to SWF, developers can create interactive applications with the data stored in XML.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to SWF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate XML to SWF conversion feature inside Android applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XML File in Android Apps" %}}
While loading XML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml", "Your@Password");
// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of SWF File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting XML to SWF, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.swf");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
