<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TEX to XAML conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. XAML is a markup language used to create user interfaces for Windows applications. It is a powerful language that allows developers to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. By converting TEX to XAML, developers can create more dynamic and engaging user interfaces for their Android applications.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected TEX File in Android via Java" %}}
While loading TEX file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open TEX document
Document doc = new Document("input.tex", "Your@Password");
// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of XAML File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting TEX to XAML, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.xaml");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
