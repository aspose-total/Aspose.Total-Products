<h2>Why to Convert JSON to CHM</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. CHM (Compiled HTML Help) is a Microsoft proprietary format for online help files. It is used to create help files for Windows applications. Converting JSON to CHM is a useful way to store and exchange data in a format that is easy to read and understand.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to CHM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout & Convert JSON Format to CHM in Android via Java" %}}
Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON format while parsing JSON to CHM using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to CHM with Watermark in Android via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to CHM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your CHM document, you can first parse the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to CHM.
