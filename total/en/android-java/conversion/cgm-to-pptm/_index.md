<h2>Why to Convert CGM to PPTM</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. PPTM (PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a presentation file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is similar to PPTX, but it supports macros and ActiveX controls. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to PPTM in order to use the data in PowerPoint presentations.

After converting CGM to PPTM, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.pptm");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
