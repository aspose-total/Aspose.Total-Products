{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Remove Unused Information from a WORD Document in Android via Java" %}}
Before converting WORD to XLSB, you can remove unused information from WORD Document via [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/). Sometimes you may need to remove unused or duplicate information to reduce the size of the output document and processing time. The [CleanupOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/CleanupOptions) class allows you to specify options for document cleaning. To remove duplicate styles or just unused styles or lists from the document, you can use the [Cleanup](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#cleanup()) method. You can use the [UnusedStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedStyles) and [UnusedBuiltinStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedBuiltinStyles) properties to detect and remove styles that are marked as “unused”.

However, the speed of the conversion process can vary depending on the size of your WORD file. If you're working with a small file, you can expect the conversion to take only a few seconds.<br />

If you're using the converter within a Android App application, the speed of the conversion process will depend on how well you've optimized your application. To get the best performance from the converter, you'll want to make sure that your application is running smoothly and efficiently. This can involve optimizing your code, reducing the amount of memory your application uses, and making sure that your application is running on a fast and reliable server.</span>

If you're using the online WORD to XLSB converter, you'll be happy to know that the download link for your converted files will be available instantly after the conversion process is complete. And don't worry about your files' security - the app deletes uploaded files after 24 hours, and the download links stop working after this time period. This ensures that no one has access to your files, and you can rest assured that your data is safe and secure.<br />
In addition, the WORD to XLSB converter is completely free to use, making it an excellent option for testing purposes. You can use the converter to test the results before integrating the code into your application. This can help you determine whether the WORD to XLSB conversion process meets your needs and whether you want to continue using the app in the future.</span>
