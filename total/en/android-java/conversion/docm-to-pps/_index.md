Are you an Android developer looking to add a document conversion feature to your application? [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) File Format Automation libraries can help you automate the document conversion process in your Android applications. In order to convert DOCM file to PPS, you can first use document manipulation API [Aspose.Words for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) to convert DOCM file format to HTML. After that by using PowerPoint API [Aspose.Slides for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPS.

Within your Android applications, the API also allows you to perform DOCM file to PPS conversion with watermark. 
In order to add a watermark to your PPS document, you can first export DOCM to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPS.
