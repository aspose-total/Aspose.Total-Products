<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. XLSX (Microsoft Excel Open XML Format) is a file format used to store and exchange data. It is the default format used by Microsoft Excel 2007 and later versions. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to XLSX in order to make the data compatible with Microsoft Excel.
