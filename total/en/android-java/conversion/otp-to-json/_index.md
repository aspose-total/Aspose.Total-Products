<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting OTP files to JSON format is a great way to make your Android applications more efficient and user-friendly. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write, making it ideal for use in Android applications. By converting OTP files to JSON, you can easily store and access data in a more organized and efficient manner.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OTP to JSON Conversion</h2>

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input OTP document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert OTP to JSON in Range in Android Apps" %}}
While you are converting OTP to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
