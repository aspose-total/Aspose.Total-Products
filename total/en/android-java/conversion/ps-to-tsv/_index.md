<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system. However, PDF files are not suitable for data analysis and manipulation. To perform such tasks, it is necessary to convert PDF files to a format that is more suitable for data manipulation, such as TSV (Tab Separated Values).
