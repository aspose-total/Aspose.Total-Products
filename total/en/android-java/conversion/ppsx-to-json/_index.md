<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The PPSX file format is a presentation file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by many applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PPSX files to other formats such as JSON in order to make them compatible with other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PPSX to JSON Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily convert PPSX files to JSON format. It provides a two-step process for converting PPSX files to JSON. In the first step, Aspose.Slides for Android via Java can be used to export the PPSX file to HTML. In the second step, Aspose.Cells for Android via Java can be used to convert the HTML to JSON format. This process is simple and efficient, and can be used to quickly convert PPSX files to JSON format.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PPSX to JSON in Range in Android Apps" %}}
While you are converting PPSX to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
