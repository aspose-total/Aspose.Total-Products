<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is an open standard for vector graphics developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It is used to create and display vector-based graphics on the web. However, the XLSX and XLTM formats are used to store and exchange data in Microsoft Excel. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to XLSX and then XLSX to XLTM in order to use the data in Microsoft Excel.
