<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, and is widely used for digital publications. However, the format is not compatible with Microsoft Excel, which is the most popular spreadsheet application. Therefore, in order to use the data from an EPUB file in Excel, it must first be converted to a compatible format such as XLSX or XLAM.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to XLAM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications for Android devices. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert EPUB to XLAM: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. 

Using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, developers can easily convert EPUB files to XLSX, the native format of Microsoft Excel. Once the file has been converted to XLSX, Aspose.Cells for Android via Java can be used to convert it to XLAM, which is the macro-enabled version of XLSX. This two-step process makes it easy to integrate EPUB to XLAM conversion into Android applications. 

Aspose.Total for Android via Java also includes a number of other APIs that can be used to create powerful applications for Android devices. These APIs include Aspose.Words for Android via Java, Aspose.Slides for Android via Java, Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java, and Aspose.Imaging for Android via Java.
