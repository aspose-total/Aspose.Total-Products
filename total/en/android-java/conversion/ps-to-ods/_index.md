<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The PostScript (PS) format is a page description language used mainly in desktop publishing applications. It is a vector-based language that describes the appearance of a printed page. On the other hand, the OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) format is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets. It is a file format for spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PS to ODS in order to make the data more accessible and easier to work with.
