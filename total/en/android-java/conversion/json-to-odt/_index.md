<h2>Why to Convert JSON to ODT?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between different applications. It is a text-based format that is easy to read and write. ODT (OpenDocument Text) is a file format used for documents such as text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, and databases. It is an open standard for document exchange and is used by many applications. Converting JSON to ODT can be useful for creating documents from data stored in JSON format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to ODT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a suite of APIs that can be used to create, manipulate, and convert documents in various formats. It includes Powerful Spreadsheet Processing API [Aspose.Cells for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/android-java/) and Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/). These APIs can be used to convert JSON to ODT in a two-step process. Firstly, Aspose.Cells for Android via Java can be used to parse JSON to PDF. In the second step, Aspose.Words for Android via Java can be used to convert PDF to ODT. This makes it easy to create documents from data stored in JSON format.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to ODT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON format while parsing JSON to ODT using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to ODT with Watermark in Android Apps" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to ODT with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your ODT document, you can first parse the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to ODT.
