<h2>Why to Convert SVG to OTP</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. It is used to create and store images in XML format. On the other hand, OpenType Font (OTF) is a font format developed by Microsoft and Adobe. It is used to store font data and is supported by most operating systems. Therefore, it is important to convert SVG to OTP in order to make the images compatible with different operating systems.
