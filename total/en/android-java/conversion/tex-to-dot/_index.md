<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The TEX to DOT conversion feature is an important tool for mobile app developers. It allows them to integrate the feature into their apps, allowing users to convert TEX files into DOT format. This is useful for a variety of tasks, such as creating diagrams, charts, and other visual representations of data.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to DOT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate TEX to DOT conversion feature into mobile apps. It consists of two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The first API, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, is used to convert TEX files into DOC format. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to convert TEX files into PDF, HTML, and other formats. It also provides support for a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.

The second API, Aspose.Words for Android Java, is used to render DOC files into DOT format. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert documents. It also provides support for a variety of document formats, including DOC, DOCX, and RTF.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate the TEX to DOT conversion feature into their mobile apps. This will allow users to quickly and easily convert TEX files into DOT format, allowing them to create diagrams, charts, and other visual representations of data.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert TEX to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOT as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get TEX File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting TEX to DOT, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a TEX file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load TEX document
Document doc = new Document("template.tex");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOT document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOT document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dot", SaveFormat.DOT);
