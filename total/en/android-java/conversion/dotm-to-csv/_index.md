<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOTM file format is a Microsoft Office Word template file used to store document settings and formatting. It is used to create new documents with the same formatting and settings as the template. However, the DOTM file format is not compatible with many other applications, making it difficult to share or use the data in other programs. Converting the DOTM file to a CSV file can make it easier to share and use the data in other applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Remove Unused Information from a DOTM Document in Android Apps" %}}
Before converting DOTM to CSV, you can remove unused information from DOTM Document via [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/). Sometimes you may need to remove unused or duplicate information to reduce the size of the output document and processing time. The [CleanupOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/CleanupOptions) class allows you to specify options for document cleaning. To remove duplicate styles or just unused styles or lists from the document, you can use the [Cleanup](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#cleanup()) method. You can use the [UnusedStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedStyles) and [UnusedBuiltinStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedBuiltinStyles) properties to detect and remove styles that are marked as “unused”.
