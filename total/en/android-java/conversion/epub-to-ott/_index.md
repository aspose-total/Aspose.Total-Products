<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to OTT?</h2>

OTT (Over-the-Top) is a streaming media service that is delivered over the internet. It is a type of media delivery system that provides audio, video, and other media content over the internet without the need for a traditional cable or satellite pay-TV subscription. OTT is becoming increasingly popular as it offers a wide range of content and services, including movies, TV shows, music, and more.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to OTT Conversion?</h2>

Integrating EPUB to OTT conversion feature in mobile apps is now possible with the help of two APIs of Aspose.Total for Android Java package. Aspose.Total is a suite of APIs that provides a comprehensive set of file format processing features for Android applications. It includes APIs for PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other file formats.

The first step in the conversion process is to convert the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a wide range of features for creating, editing, and converting PDF documents. It also supports the conversion of PDF documents to other file formats, including DOC.

Once the EPUB file is converted to DOC, the Word Processing API, Aspose.Words for Android Java, can be used to render the DOC to OTT. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and converting Word documents. It also supports the conversion of Word documents to other file formats, including OTT.

By using the two APIs of Aspose.Total for Android Java package, developers can easily integrate EPUB to OTT conversion feature in their mobile apps. This will enable them to provide their users with a wide range of content and services, including movies, TV shows, music, and more.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get EPUB File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting EPUB to OTT, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a EPUB file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("template.epub");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in OTT document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a OTT document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.ott", SaveFormat.OTT);
