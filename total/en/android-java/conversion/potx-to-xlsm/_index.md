<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Office Open XML (POTX) format is a file format used to store presentations created in Microsoft Office PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of the PowerPoint Open XML (PPTX) format, and is used to reduce the size of the file. However, the POTX format is not compatible with other applications, and so it is necessary to convert it to a more widely used format such as XLSM.
