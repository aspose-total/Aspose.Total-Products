<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The PPSX file format is a presentation file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a proprietary format that is not compatible with other software applications. Therefore, if you need to use the data in the PPSX file in other applications, you will need to convert it to a different format. One of the most popular formats for data exchange is the XLSM format, which is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format.
