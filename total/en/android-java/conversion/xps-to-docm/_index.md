{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XPS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting XPS to DOCM, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a XPS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load XPS document
Document doc = new Document("template.xps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOCM document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOCM document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.docm", SaveFormat.DOCM);
