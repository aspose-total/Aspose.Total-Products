<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not compatible with Microsoft Word. To be able to open and edit an EPUB file in Word, it must first be converted to the DOTM format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to DOTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate EPUB to DOTM conversion feature into mobile apps. The package includes two APIs that can be used to convert EPUB files to DOTM format. 

The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert EPUB files to DOC format. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF files to other formats. 

The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC files to DOTM format. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with Word documents, including the ability to convert documents to other formats. 

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate EPUB to DOTM conversion feature into their mobile apps. This feature can be used to open and edit EPUB files in Microsoft Word.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get EPUB File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting EPUB to DOTM, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a EPUB file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("template.epub");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOTM document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOTM document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.DOTM);
