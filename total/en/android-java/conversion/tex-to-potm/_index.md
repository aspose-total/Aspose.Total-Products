<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The TEX format is a plain text format used for typesetting documents. It is widely used in scientific and technical documents, and is the preferred format for many publishers. On the other hand, the POTM format is a Microsoft Office Open XML format used for presentations. It is a popular format for creating and sharing presentations, and is supported by many applications. Converting TEX to POTM allows users to create presentations from their TEX documents, and share them with others.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTM file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.potm");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
