<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to Excel?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML documents, which is used to define the layout of a document. It is used to define the page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting information. XSLFO is used to generate PDF documents, but it is not suitable for data analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to convert XSLFO to Excel, which is a popular spreadsheet application used for data analysis.
