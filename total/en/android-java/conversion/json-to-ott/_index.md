<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between different applications. It is a text-based, human-readable format that is used to represent simple data structures and objects. On the other hand, OTT (OpenType Table) is a format used to store font information. It is a binary format that is used to store font data such as glyphs, outlines, and metrics.
