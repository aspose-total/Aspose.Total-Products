<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting a PPTX file to CSV is a great way to make the data in the presentation more accessible and easier to work with. CSV files are widely used in data analysis and data science, and can be opened in a variety of programs, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers. Converting a PPTX file to CSV can also make it easier to share the data with others, as CSV files are more widely supported than PPTX files.
