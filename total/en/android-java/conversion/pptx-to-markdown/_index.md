<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting a PPTX file to MARKDOWN can be beneficial in many ways. MARKDOWN is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents.

It is also used for creating documents that can be easily shared and edited by multiple users. By converting a PPTX file to MARKDOWN, you can make it easier to share and edit the document with others.
