Are you an Android developer looking to add a document conversion feature to your application? [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) File Format Automation libraries can help you automate the document conversion process in your Android applications. In order to convert WORDML file to PPSX, you can first use document manipulation API [Aspose.Words for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) to convert WORDML file format to HTML. After that by using PowerPoint API [Aspose.Slides for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPSX.

Within your Android applications, the API also allows you to perform WORDML file to PPSX conversion with watermark. 
In order to add a watermark to your PPSX document, you can first export WORDML to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPSX.
