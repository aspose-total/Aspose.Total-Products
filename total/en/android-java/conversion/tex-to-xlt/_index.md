<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The TEX to XLT conversion feature is a useful tool for Android application developers. It allows them to quickly and easily convert TEX files into the XLSX format, which is the native format for Microsoft Excel. This makes it easier for users to view and edit the data in the file, as well as to share the data with other users.
