<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Presentation Slide Show (PPSM) format is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a binary file format that is not easily readable by humans. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. It is an open standard format that is used to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types. Converting PPSM to JSON makes it easier to read and manipulate the data.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

While you are converting PPSM to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
