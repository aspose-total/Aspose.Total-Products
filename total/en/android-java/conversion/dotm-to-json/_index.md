You can convert DOTM to JSON format in your Android Applications via [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/). By using document manipulation and conversion API [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/), you can export DOTM to HTML. After that, by using [Aspose.Cells for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/android-java/), you can convert HTML to JSON.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected DOTM to JSON Format in Android via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input DOTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how open an encrypted document with a password.

While you are converting DOTM to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
