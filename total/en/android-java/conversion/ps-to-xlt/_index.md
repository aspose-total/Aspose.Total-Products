<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular file format used for documents that require a high degree of accuracy and portability. However, the PDF format is not suitable for data analysis and manipulation. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF documents to other formats such as XLSX and XLT.
