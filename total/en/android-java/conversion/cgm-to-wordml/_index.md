<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. However, it is not supported by many applications, including Microsoft Word. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to a format that is supported by Word, such as WORDML.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to WORDML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate CGM to WORDML conversion feature in mobile apps. It includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API can be used to convert CGM files to DOC format. It supports a wide range of file formats, including CGM, and provides a range of features such as text extraction, image extraction, and document manipulation.

The Aspose.Words for Android Java API can be used to render DOC to WORDML. It provides a range of features such as document manipulation, text manipulation, and document conversion. It also supports a wide range of file formats, including DOC, WORDML, and HTML.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate CGM to WORDML conversion feature in their mobile apps. This will enable users to view and edit CGM files in Word without any compatibility issues.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get CGM File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting CGM to WORDML, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a CGM file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load CGM document
Document doc = new Document("template.cgm");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in WORDML document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a WORDML document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.word_ml", SaveFormat.WORD_ML);
