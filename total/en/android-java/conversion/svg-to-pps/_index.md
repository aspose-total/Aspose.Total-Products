<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a popular choice for displaying vector graphics on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. However, the Portable Presentation Format (PPS) is a file format used to store slides for a presentation created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of the PowerPoint Presentation (PPT) file format. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to PPS in order to use the vector graphics in a PowerPoint presentation.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.pps");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
