<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its compatibility with most operating systems and devices. However, the PDF format does not support some features such as macros, which are available in the Microsoft Office Word format. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF files to the Word format in order to use these features.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for pcl to docm conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful mobile applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to integrate PCL to DOCM conversion feature in mobile apps. 

The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert PCL files to DOC. This API supports a wide range of features such as text extraction, image extraction, and page manipulation. It also supports the conversion of PCL files to other formats such as HTML, XPS, and PDF.

The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC to DOCM. This API supports a wide range of features such as document manipulation, text manipulation, and document conversion. It also supports the conversion of DOC files to other formats such as HTML, PDF, and XPS.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate PCL to DOCM conversion feature in their mobile apps. This feature can be used to convert PDF files to the Word format in order to use features such as macros, which are not available in the PDF format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PCL File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PCL to DOCM, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PCL file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load PCL document
Document doc = new Document("template.pcl");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOCM document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOCM document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.docm", SaveFormat.DOCM);
