<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting MOBI to XLSB is a useful process for many reasons. XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel, and it is a more efficient way to store data than other formats such as HTML. XLSB files are smaller in size and can be opened and edited faster than other formats. Additionally, XLSB files are more secure than other formats, as they are not as vulnerable to malicious attacks.
