<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not compatible with Microsoft Word. To be able to open and edit an EPUB file in Word, it needs to be converted to the DOCM format. This is why it is important to be able to convert EPUB to DOCM.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to DOCM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a package of APIs that can be used to integrate EPUB to DOCM conversion feature in mobile apps. The package includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The first step is to convert the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a set of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF to other formats such as DOC. 

The second step is to render the DOC file to DOCM using Aspose.Words for Android Java. This API provides a set of features to manipulate Word documents, including the ability to convert DOC to other formats such as DOCM. 

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate EPUB to DOCM conversion feature in their mobile apps. This will enable users to open and edit EPUB files in Microsoft Word.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get EPUB File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting EPUB to DOCM, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a EPUB file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("template.epub");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOCM document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOCM document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.docm", SaveFormat.DOCM);
