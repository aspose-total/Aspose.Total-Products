<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XML to FODS conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. FODS (Flat Open Document Spreadsheet) is a file format used to store spreadsheet documents. It is an open standard, and is supported by many applications, including OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Converting XML to FODS allows users to view and edit the data in a spreadsheet format, making it easier to analyze and manipulate.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to FODS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.PDF for Android via Java can be used to convert XML to XLSX, a Microsoft Excel file format. Aspose.Cells for Android via Java can then be used to convert the XLSX file to FODS. Both APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features, such as support for various file formats, the ability to manipulate documents, and the ability to generate reports.
