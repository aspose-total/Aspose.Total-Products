<h2>Why to Convert JSON to PPSX?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. PPSX (PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show) is a presentation format developed by Microsoft. It is used to store slides in a presentation created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of the PPTX format and is used to store slideshows.

Converting JSON to PPSX is beneficial for many reasons. Firstly, it allows users to view the data in a more organized and visually appealing way. Secondly, it allows users to easily share the data with others. Lastly, it allows users to make changes to the data quickly and easily.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPSX format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to PPSX with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPSX with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPSX document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPSX.
