<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting a POTX file to JSON format is a great way to make the data more accessible and easier to use. JSON is a popular data format that is used for a variety of applications, including web development and mobile applications. By converting a POTX file to JSON, you can make the data more accessible and easier to use in your Android applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for POTX to JSON Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of components that can help you easily convert POTX files to JSON format. The process is a two-step process that involves exporting the POTX file to HTML using Aspose.Slides for Android via Java, and then converting the HTML to JSON format using Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. This makes it easy to convert POTX files to JSON format in your Android applications.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input POTX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert POTX to JSON in Range in Android Apps" %}}
While you are converting POTX to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
