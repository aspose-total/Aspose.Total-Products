<h2>Why to Convert JSON to FLATOPC?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays. FLATOPC is a file format used to store data in a tabular form. It is a popular format used to store data in a spreadsheet. Converting JSON to FLATOPC is a useful process for data analysis and manipulation.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to FLATOPC Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a suite of APIs that can be used to convert JSON to FLATOPC in Android applications. It consists of two APIs, namely, Powerful Spreadsheet Processing API [Aspose.Cells for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/android-java/) and Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/). The conversion process is done in two steps. Firstly, the JSON is parsed to PDF using Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. In the second step, the PDF is converted to FLATOPC using Aspose.Words for Android via Java. Both APIs are available as part of the Aspose.Total for Android via Java product family. This makes it easy to convert JSON to FLATOPC in Android applications.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to FLATOPC format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout & Convert JSON Format to FLATOPC in Android via Java" %}}
Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON format while parsing JSON to FLATOPC using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to FLATOPC with Watermark in Android via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to FLATOPC with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your FLATOPC document, you can first parse the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to FLATOPC.
