<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language used to describe the formatting of a document. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting details. TSV (Tab Separated Values) is a simple text format used for tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Converting XSLFO to TSV allows users to easily view and manipulate the data in a spreadsheet or database.
