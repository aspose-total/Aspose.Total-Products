Integrating MD to SWF conversion feature into your Android applications is now possible with just two simple steps. The first step involves exporting MD to PPTX using [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/). This API is part of the [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) package. After that, you can use [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) to convert PPTX to SWF. This API is also part of the same package.

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents. It allows you to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also supports features such as text extraction, page manipulation, and image extraction.

The Aspose.Slides for Android via Java API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and converting presentations. It supports features such as text formatting, slide manipulation, and animation. It also supports features such as adding shapes, images, and text boxes.

By using the two APIs, you can easily integrate MD to SWF conversion feature into your Android applications. The APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features for manipulating documents and presentations. With the help of these APIs, you can quickly and easily convert MD to SWF and integrate the feature into your Android applications.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MD to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected MD File in Android Apps" %}}
While loading MD file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open MD document
Document doc = new Document("input.md", "Your@Password");
// save MD as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of SWF File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting MD to SWF, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.swf");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
```
