<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not compatible with Microsoft Excel. To be able to use the data in an EPUB file in Excel, it must be converted to the XLSM format. This is where the two-step process of EPUB to XLSM conversion comes in.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to XLSM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a powerful suite of APIs that can help you integrate EPUB to XLSM conversion feature within your android applications. The first step of the process is to convert EPUB to XLSX using [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/). This API allows you to easily convert EPUB files to XLSX format.

The second step is to convert XLSX to XLSM using [Aspose.Cells for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/android-java/). This powerful spreadsheet processing API allows you to easily convert XLSX files to XLSM format. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for Android via Java product family, making it easy to integrate the two-step process into your android applications.
