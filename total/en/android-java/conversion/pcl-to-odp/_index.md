<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its ability to maintain the original formatting of the document. However, the OpenDocument Presentation (ODP) format is the native format for presentations in OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Therefore, if you need to create a presentation from a PDF document, you will need to convert it to ODP.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a ODP file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.odp");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
