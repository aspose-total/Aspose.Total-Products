<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
MHTML to MD conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format which is used to save webpages for offline viewing. MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is used for creating webpages, documentation, and notes. Converting MHTML to MD allows users to view webpages offline in a more organized and readable format.
