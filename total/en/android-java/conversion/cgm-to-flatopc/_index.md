<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. However, it is not supported by many mobile applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to a more widely supported format such as FLATOPC.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to FLATOPC Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate CGM to FLATOPC conversion feature in your mobile apps. It includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API can be used to convert CGM files to DOC format. This API supports a wide range of file formats, including CGM, and provides a range of features such as document manipulation, text extraction, and image conversion.

The Aspose.Words for Android Java API can be used to render DOC to FLATOPC. This API provides a range of features such as document manipulation, text extraction, and image conversion. It also supports a wide range of file formats, including FLATOPC.

By using these two APIs, you can easily integrate CGM to FLATOPC conversion feature in your mobile apps. This will enable you to view CGM files on your mobile device without any compatibility issues.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to FLAT_OPC format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set FLAT_OPC as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get CGM File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting CGM to FLATOPC, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a CGM file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load CGM document
Document doc = new Document("template.cgm");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in FLATOPC document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a FLATOPC document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.flat_opc", SaveFormat.FLAT_OPC);
