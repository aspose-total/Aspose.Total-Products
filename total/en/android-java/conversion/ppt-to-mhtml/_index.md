While converting PPT file to MHTML, you can also add watermark to your output MHTML file format. In order to add a watermark, create a new Workbook to open the converted HTML file. Select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its addTextEffect function, set colors, transparency and more. After that you can save your HTML document as MHTML with Watermark.
