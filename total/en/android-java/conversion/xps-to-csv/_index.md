<h2>Why to Convert XPS to CSV</h2>

XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a document format developed by Microsoft for printing and viewing documents. It is similar to PDF format but XPS documents are more structured and can be edited. On the other hand, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a plain text format used for storing tabular data. It is widely used for data exchange between different applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert XPS to CSV in order to make the data accessible to other applications.
