<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format is a widely used vector image format, which is used to create and display images on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. On the other hand, XLT is a Microsoft Excel template file format that is used to store a worksheet template. It is used to create a new workbook with the same formatting and formulas as the template file. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to XLT in order to use the same formatting and formulas in the new workbook.
