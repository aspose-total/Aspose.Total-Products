Integrating SVG to SWF conversion feature into your Android applications is now possible with two simple steps. By using [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/), you can export SVG to PPTX in the first step. Then, [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) can be used to convert PPTX to SWF. Both of these APIs are included in the [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) package.

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API allows you to easily export SVG to PPTX. It supports a wide range of features, such as text extraction, image extraction, and document manipulation. It also supports the conversion of SVG to PPTX, which is the first step in the SVG to SWF conversion process.

The Aspose.Slides for Android via Java API is used to convert PPTX to SWF. It supports a wide range of features, such as text formatting, image manipulation, and animation. It also supports the conversion of PPTX to SWF, which is the second step in the SVG to SWF conversion process.

By using the Aspose.Total for Android via Java package, you can easily integrate SVG to SWF conversion feature into your Android applications. It includes both the Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java APIs, which are necessary for the SVG to SWF conversion process. With this package, you can easily export SVG to PPTX and then convert PPTX to SWF.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

```java
// load SVG file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.svg");
// save SVG as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Swf format
presentation.save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected SVG File in Android Apps" %}}
While loading SVG file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open SVG document
Document doc = new Document("input.svg", "Your@Password");
// save SVG as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of SWF File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting SVG to SWF, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.swf");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
```
