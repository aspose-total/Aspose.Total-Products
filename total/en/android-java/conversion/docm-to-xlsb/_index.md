<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOCM file format is a Microsoft Word document that contains macros, which are pieces of code that automate tasks. This type of file is not compatible with many other applications, so it is necessary to convert it to a more widely accepted format such as XLSB. XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel that is optimized for storing large spreadsheets.
