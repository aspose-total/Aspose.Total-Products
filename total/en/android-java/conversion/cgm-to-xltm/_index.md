<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. XLSX (Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet) is a file format used for storing and exchanging data in tabular form. XLTM (Microsoft Excel Open XML Macro-Enabled Spreadsheet) is a file format used for storing and exchanging data in tabular form with macros enabled. Converting CGM to XLTM is necessary to make the data more accessible and easier to use.
