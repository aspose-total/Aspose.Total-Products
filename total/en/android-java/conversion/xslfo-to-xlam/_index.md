<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML vocabulary used to describe the formatting of a document. It is used to generate PDF documents from XML documents. XLSX (Excel Open XML) is a file format used to store and transport data in Microsoft Excel. XLAM (Excel Add-in) is a file format used to store macros and other custom functions in Microsoft Excel. Converting XSLFO to XLAM allows users to access the data stored in XSLFO documents in Microsoft Excel.
