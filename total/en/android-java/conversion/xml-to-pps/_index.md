<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XML to PPS conversion is an important feature for Android applications. It allows users to export XML data into a PPS format, which is a presentation format that can be used to create slideshows. This is useful for creating presentations that can be shared with others or used for other purposes.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to PPS Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a package that provides two APIs for XML to PPS conversion. The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to export XML to PPTX. The second API is Aspose.Slides for Android via Java, which can be used to convert PPTX to PPS. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total package, making it easy to integrate XML to PPS conversion into Android applications.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Pps` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XML File in Android via Java" %}}
While loading XML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml", "Your@Password");
// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of PPS File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting XML to PPS, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.pps");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
