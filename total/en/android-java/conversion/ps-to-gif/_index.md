<h2>Why to Convert PS to GIF</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents, and the PostScript (PS) format is used for printing documents. However, the GIF format is more suitable for web applications, as it is a compressed image format that supports animation. Converting PS to GIF can be useful for displaying documents on the web, as it can reduce the file size and make the document easier to view.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to GIF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate various features into mobile applications. It includes APIs for PDF, Word Processing, and other file formats. Using Aspose.Total, you can easily integrate PS to GIF conversion feature in your mobile apps.

The first step is to convert the PS file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API allows you to convert PDF documents to other formats, including DOC. Once the PS file is converted to DOC, you can use the Word Processing API, Aspose.Words for Android Java, to render the DOC to GIF. This API provides a range of features for manipulating and converting Word documents.

By using Aspose.Total for Android Java, you can quickly and easily integrate PS to GIF conversion feature in your mobile apps. This can be useful for displaying documents on the web, as it can reduce the file size and make the document easier to view.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PS to GIF, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.

```java
// load PS document
Document doc = new Document("template.ps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in GIF document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a GIF document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.gif", SaveFormat.GIF);
