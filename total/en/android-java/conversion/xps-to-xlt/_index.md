<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XPS to XLT conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. XPS is a fixed-layout document format that is used to store documents in a way that is independent of the application and hardware used to create it. XLT is a template file format used by Microsoft Excel. It is used to create new workbooks based on the template. By converting XPS to XLT, users can create new workbooks with the same formatting and layout as the original XPS document.
