<h2>Why to Convert JSON to PPS</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between different applications. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write. On the other hand, PPS (PowerPoint Show) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations. It is a binary file format that is used to store slideshows. Converting JSON to PPS can be useful for creating presentations from data stored in JSON format.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to PPS with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPS with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPS document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPS.
