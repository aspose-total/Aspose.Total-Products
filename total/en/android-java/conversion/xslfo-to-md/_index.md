<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML document formatting. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and columns. On the other hand, MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is used to create rich text documents that can be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats. Therefore, it is necessary to convert XSLFO to MD in order to make the document more accessible and easier to read.
