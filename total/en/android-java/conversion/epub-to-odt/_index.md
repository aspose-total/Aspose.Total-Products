<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting EPUB to ODT is a useful process for mobile app developers. ODT is an open document format that is used to store documents, such as text, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, and databases. It is a popular format for documents that are shared between different applications and platforms. By converting EPUB to ODT, mobile app developers can ensure that their documents are compatible with a wide range of applications and platforms.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to ODT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate EPUB to ODT conversion feature in mobile apps. The package includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API can be used to convert EPUB files to DOC format. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to convert PDF documents to other formats, extract text from PDF documents, and convert PDF documents to images.

The Aspose.Words for Android Java API can be used to render DOC to ODT. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert documents, as well as the ability to insert, delete, and manipulate text, images, and other elements.

By using these two APIs, mobile app developers can easily integrate EPUB to ODT conversion feature in their apps. This will enable them to ensure that their documents are compatible with a wide range of applications and platforms.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get EPUB File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting EPUB to ODT, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a EPUB file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.

```java
// load EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("template.epub");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in ODT document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a ODT document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.odt", SaveFormat.ODT);
