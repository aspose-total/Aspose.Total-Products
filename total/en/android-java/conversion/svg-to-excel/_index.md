<h2>Why to Convert SVG to Excel?</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. It is widely used for web graphics, and can also be used for other types of images. However, it is not compatible with Microsoft Excel, which is the most popular spreadsheet application. Therefore, if you want to use SVG images in Excel, you need to convert them to the XLSX format.
