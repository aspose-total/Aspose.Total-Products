<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular file format used for documents that require a high degree of accuracy and portability. It is widely used for sharing documents, as it is compatible with most operating systems and devices. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing or manipulating data. The Data Interchange Format (DIF) is a file format that is designed for data manipulation and editing. It is a popular choice for data exchange between different applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PPTX files to DIF in order to edit and manipulate the data.
