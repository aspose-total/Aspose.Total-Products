<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. XLSX (Microsoft Excel Open XML Format) is a file format used for storing and exchanging data in tabular form. XLAM (Excel Add-in) is a file format used for creating and storing Excel add-ins. Converting CGM to XLAM is a useful process for creating Excel add-ins from CGM files.
