<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its ability to preserve the formatting of the original document. However, PDF files are not always the best choice for editing or manipulating data. In such cases, it is often necessary to convert PDF files to other formats such as DIF (Data Interchange Format).
