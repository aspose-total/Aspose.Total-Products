<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting documents from one format to another is a common requirement for many applications. For example, converting a DOC file to a TSV file can be useful for data analysis and manipulation. It can also be used to create a spreadsheet from a document, or to export data from a document to a database.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOC to TSV Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate document manipulation and conversion features into Android applications. It includes the Aspose.Words for Android via Java API, which can be used to convert DOC files to HTML. The Aspose.Cells for Java API can then be used to convert the HTML to TSV. This allows developers to quickly and easily integrate DOC to TSV conversion into their Android applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Remove Unused Information from a DOC Document in Android Apps" %}}
Before converting DOC to TSV, you can remove unused information from DOC Document via [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/). Sometimes you may need to remove unused or duplicate information to reduce the size of the output document and processing time. The [CleanupOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/CleanupOptions) class allows you to specify options for document cleaning. To remove duplicate styles or just unused styles or lists from the document, you can use the [Cleanup](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#cleanup()) method. You can use the [UnusedStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedStyles) and [UnusedBuiltinStyles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/cleanupoptions#UnusedBuiltinStyles) properties to detect and remove styles that are marked as “unused”.

After converting DOC to TSV, [Aspose.Cells for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/android-java/) enables you to save your document to stream. If you need to save files to a Stream then you should create a FileOutputStream object and then [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.io.OutputStream,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) the file to that Stream object by calling the save method of [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object.

However, the speed of the conversion process can vary depending on the size of your DOC file. If you're working with a small file, you can expect the conversion to take only a few seconds.<br />

If you're using the converter within a Android App application, the speed of the conversion process will depend on how well you've optimized your application. To get the best performance from the converter, you'll want to make sure that your application is running smoothly and efficiently. This can involve optimizing your code, reducing the amount of memory your application uses, and making sure that your application is running on a fast and reliable server.</span>

If you're using the online DOC to TSV converter, you'll be happy to know that the download link for your converted files will be available instantly after the conversion process is complete. And don't worry about your files' security - the app deletes uploaded files after 24 hours, and the download links stop working after this time period. This ensures that no one has access to your files, and you can rest assured that your data is safe and secure.<br />
In addition, the DOC to TSV converter is completely free to use, making it an excellent option for testing purposes. You can use the converter to test the results before integrating the code into your application. This can help you determine whether the DOC to TSV conversion process meets your needs and whether you want to continue using the app in the future.</span>
