<h2>Why to Convert JSON to DOCM?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write. On the other hand, DOCM is a Microsoft Word document file format that is used to store documents. It is a binary file format that is used to store documents with macros. Therefore, it is necessary to convert JSON to DOCM in order to store and exchange data in a more secure and efficient manner.
