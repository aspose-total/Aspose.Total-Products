<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is a file format for 2D vector graphics, raster graphics, and text. It is used in engineering, technical illustration, and other fields. On the other hand, the OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) is a file format for spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. It is used for creating and editing spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to ODS in order to use the data in spreadsheets.
