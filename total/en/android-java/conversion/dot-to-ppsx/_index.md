Are you an Android developer looking to add a document conversion feature to your application? [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) File Format Automation libraries can help you automate the document conversion process in your Android applications. In order to convert DOT file to PPSX, you can first use document manipulation API [Aspose.Words for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) to convert DOT file format to HTML. After that by using PowerPoint API [Aspose.Slides for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPSX.

You can also convert your password-protected DOT to PPSX within your Android applications. If your input DOT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPSX format without using the password. In order to open an encrypted document, you can set the correct password in the LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.
