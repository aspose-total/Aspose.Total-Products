Are you an Android developer looking to add a document conversion feature to your application? [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) File Format Automation libraries can help you automate the document conversion process in your Android applications. In order to convert OTT file to PPTX, you can first use document manipulation API [Aspose.Words for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) to convert OTT file format to HTML. After that by using PowerPoint API [Aspose.Slides for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as PPTX.
