<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting MD to ODS is a useful process for Android developers who need to integrate this feature into their applications. MD is a markdown language used to create documents, while ODS is an open document spreadsheet format. Converting MD to ODS allows developers to create documents with spreadsheets that can be used in a variety of applications.
