<h2>Why to Convert XPS to XAML?</h2>

XPS (XML Paper Specification) is an open standard for document exchange that is used to represent electronic documents in a consistent way across multiple applications, platforms, and devices. XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) is a declarative XML-based language developed by Microsoft that is used for initializing structured values and objects. It is used to create user interfaces in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, and Windows Store applications.

XPS to XAML conversion is necessary for Android applications that need to display documents in a consistent way across multiple platforms and devices. XAML is a powerful language that can be used to create user interfaces for Android applications, and XPS to XAML conversion allows developers to easily integrate this feature into their applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XPS to XAML Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, manipulate, and convert documents in a variety of formats. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert XPS to XAML: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java.

The first step in the XPS to XAML conversion process is to export XPS to PPTX using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API allows developers to easily convert XPS documents to PPTX format, which can then be converted to XAML using Aspose.Slides for Android via Java. This API provides developers with the ability to convert PPTX documents to XAML, allowing them to easily integrate XPS to XAML conversion into their Android applications.

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for Android via Java provides developers with the tools they need to easily convert XPS to XAML. By using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java, developers can easily export XPS to PPTX and then convert PPTX to XAML, allowing them to integrate XPS to XAML conversion into their Android applications.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XPS to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

```java
// load XPS file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.xps");
// save XPS as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Xaml format
presentation.save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XPS File in Android via Java" %}}
While loading XPS file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XPS document
Document doc = new Document("input.xps", "Your@Password");
// save XPS as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of XAML File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting XPS to XAML, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.xaml");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
```
