<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format that is used to create and display images on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. On the other hand, SXC is a spreadsheet format used by OpenOffice Calc, a free and open source spreadsheet application. It is a compressed version of the OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) format and is used to store data in a tabular form. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to SXC in order to use the data in OpenOffice Calc.
