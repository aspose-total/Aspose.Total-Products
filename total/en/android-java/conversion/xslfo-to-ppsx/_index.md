<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to PPSX?</h2>

PPSX (PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show) is a presentation file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a combination of XML elements and binary files that are used to store slides and other presentation elements. Converting XSLFO to PPSX allows users to create presentations from XML documents.
