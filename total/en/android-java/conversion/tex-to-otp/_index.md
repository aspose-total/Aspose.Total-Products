<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert TEX to OTP arises when you want to integrate the feature of TEX to OTP conversion in your Android applications. TEX is a document format used for typesetting documents, while OTP is a presentation format used for creating presentations. Converting TEX to OTP allows you to create presentations from documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to OTP Conversion</h2>

By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a OTP file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.otp");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
