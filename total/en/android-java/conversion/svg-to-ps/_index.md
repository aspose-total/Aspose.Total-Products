<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a popular choice for creating and displaying vector graphics on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. However, it is not supported by all devices and platforms, and so it is often necessary to convert SVG to other formats such as PostScript (PS).

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to PS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides a wide range of features for developing mobile applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to integrate SVG to PS conversion feature in your mobile apps. 

The first step is to convert SVG file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a wide range of features for creating, editing, and manipulating PDF documents. It supports a variety of formats, including SVG, and can be used to convert SVG to DOC.

The second step is to render DOC to PS using Aspose.Words for Android Java. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and manipulating Word documents. It supports a variety of formats, including DOC, and can be used to render DOC to PS.

By using these two APIs, you can easily integrate SVG to PS conversion feature in your mobile apps. This will allow you to display vector graphics on any device or platform, regardless of whether it supports SVG or not.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get SVG File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting SVG to PS, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a SVG file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load SVG document
Document doc = new Document("template.svg");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in PS document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a PS document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.ps", SaveFormat.PS);
