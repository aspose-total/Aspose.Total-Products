<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system. However, the PDF format is not suitable for presentations. To make presentations, the Portable Presentation Slide Markup (PPSM) format is used. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF documents to PPSM format for presentations.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to PPSM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, and other file formats. Using Aspose.Total for Android via Java, developers can easily integrate the feature of converting PDF documents to PPSM format inside their Android applications.

The process of converting PDF documents to PPSM format involves two steps. In the first step, the PDF document is exported to PPTX format using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. After that, Aspose.Slides for Android via Java is used to convert the PPTX document to PPSM format. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for Android via Java package.

Therefore, developers can use Aspose.Total for Android via Java to integrate the feature of converting PDF documents to PPSM format inside their Android applications. This feature can be used to create presentations from PDF documents.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSM file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.ppsm");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
