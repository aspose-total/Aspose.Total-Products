<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format that is used to create and display images on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. On the other hand, the PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Presentation (PPTM) format is a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation file format that supports macros. It is used to store presentations that contain macros, scripts, or other programming code. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to PPTM in order to use the images in a presentation.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.pptm");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
