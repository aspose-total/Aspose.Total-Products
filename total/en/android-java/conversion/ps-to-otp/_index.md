<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is often used for archiving and printing. However, PDFs are not always the best format for sharing documents. For example, if you need to make changes to a document, it is often easier to use a presentation format such as OpenDocument Presentation (OTP). Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PDFs to OTP.

In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}

// open PS document
Document doc = new Document("input.ps", "Your@Password");
// save PS as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a OTP file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.otp");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
