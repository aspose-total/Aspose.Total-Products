<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XPS to SXC conversion is a necessary process for many Android applications. XPS is a document format that is used to store documents in a fixed layout format, while SXC is a spreadsheet format used to store data in a tabular format. Converting XPS to SXC allows users to access the data stored in the XPS document in a more organized and efficient manner.
