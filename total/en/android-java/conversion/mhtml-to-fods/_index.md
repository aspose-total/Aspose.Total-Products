<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save and share web content. It is a combination of HTML code and resources like images, audio, and video. FODS (Flat OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets, and is an XML-based file format. It is used to store data in a tabular format. Converting MHTML to FODS is beneficial as it allows users to view and edit the data in a tabular format.
