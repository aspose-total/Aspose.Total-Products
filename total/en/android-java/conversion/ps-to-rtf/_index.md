<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its compatibility with most operating systems and devices. However, the Rich Text Format (RTF) is also a popular file format for documents, and is often used for text-based documents such as resumes and letters. Converting a PDF file to RTF can be useful for editing the document, or for sharing it with someone who does not have access to a PDF reader.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to RTF Conversion</h2>

Integrating PS to RTF conversion feature in mobile apps can be done by using two APIs of the Aspose.Total for Android Java package. The first step is to convert the PS file to DOC using the Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API. This API provides a range of features for manipulating PDF files, including the ability to convert PDF files to other formats. Once the PS file has been converted to DOC, the Word Processing API, Aspose.Words for Android Java, can be used to render the DOC to RTF. This API provides a range of features for manipulating Word documents, including the ability to convert documents to other formats. By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate PS to RTF conversion feature in their mobile apps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PS to RTF, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load PS document
Document doc = new Document("template.ps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in RTF document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a RTF document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.rtf", SaveFormat.RTF);
