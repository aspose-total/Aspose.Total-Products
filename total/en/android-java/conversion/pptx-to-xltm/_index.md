<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting a PPTX file to XLTM can be beneficial in many ways. XLTM is a file format that is used to store spreadsheets, charts, and other data in a tabular format. It is a great way to store and share data, as it is compatible with a wide range of applications. Additionally, XLTM files are smaller in size than PPTX files, making them easier to share and store.
