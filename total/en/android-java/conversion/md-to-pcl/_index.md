<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert MD files to PCL format is becoming increasingly important as mobile applications become more popular. PCL is a printer control language that is used to control the printing of documents on a variety of printers. It is a widely used format for printing documents, and is supported by many mobile applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to PCL Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate MD to PCL conversion feature in mobile apps. It includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java.

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API can be used to convert MD files to DOC format. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to convert MD files to DOC.

The Aspose.Words for Android Java API can then be used to render the DOC file to PCL. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating Word documents, including the ability to render DOC files to PCL.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate MD to PCL conversion feature in their mobile apps. This will enable them to print documents in PCL format, which is supported by many mobile applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get MD File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting MD to PCL, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a MD file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load MD document
Document doc = new Document("template.md");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in PCL document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a PCL document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.pcl", SaveFormat.PCL);
