<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
MHTML to XLSB conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. MHTML is a web page archive format which is used to save webpages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources like images, audio, and video. XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel. It is used to store spreadsheet data and is more efficient than the XLSX format. Converting MHTML to XLSB allows users to view the web page data in a spreadsheet format.
