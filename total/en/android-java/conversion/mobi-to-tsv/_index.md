<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The MOBI format is a popular ebook format, but it is not compatible with many other applications. To make the content of a MOBI file accessible to other applications, it must be converted to a different format. One of the most popular formats for this purpose is TSV, which stands for Tab Separated Values. TSV is a plain text format that is easy to read and manipulate, making it ideal for data analysis and other tasks.
