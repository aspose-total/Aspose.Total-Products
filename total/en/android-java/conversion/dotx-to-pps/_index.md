Are you an Android developer looking to add a document conversion feature to your application? [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) File Format Automation libraries can help you automate the document conversion process in your Android applications. In order to convert DOTX file to PPS, you can first use document manipulation API [Aspose.Words for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) to convert DOTX file format to HTML.

You can also convert your password-protected DOTX to PPS within your Android applications. If your input DOTX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to PPS format without using the password. In order to open an encrypted document, you can set the correct password in the LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.
