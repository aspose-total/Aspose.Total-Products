<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents as it is platform independent and can be opened on any device. However, it is not suitable for editing. OpenDocument Presentation (ODP) is an open standard for presentations that is used by many applications. It is an editable format and is used for creating presentations. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF to ODP in order to edit the content of the document.
