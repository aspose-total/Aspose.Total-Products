<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

EPUB is a popular file format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format that is used to create and publish digital books. However, it is not compatible with Microsoft Word, which is the most popular word processing software. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to DOTX, which is a template file format used by Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for epub to dotx conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate EPUB to DOTX conversion feature in mobile apps. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. The former can be used to convert EPUB file to DOC, while the latter can be used to render DOC to DOTX. This makes it easy to integrate EPUB to DOTX conversion feature in mobile apps. Moreover, Aspose.Total for Android Java is a reliable and secure solution that can be used to convert EPUB to DOTX quickly and accurately.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get EPUB File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting EPUB to DOTX, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a EPUB file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("template.epub");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Insert Endnotes in DOTX Document in Android via Java" %}}
Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOTX document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOTX document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dotx", SaveFormat.DOTX);
