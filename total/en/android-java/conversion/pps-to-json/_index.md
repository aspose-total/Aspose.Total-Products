<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Presentation Format (PPS) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of the PowerPoint Presentation (PPT) file format and is used to store slideshows. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types. It is a lightweight data-interchange format. Converting PPS to JSON format is beneficial as it allows you to easily access and manipulate the data.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for pps to json conversion</h2>

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

While you are converting PPS to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
