<h2>Why to Convert XPS to Markdown?</h2>

XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a document format developed by Microsoft. It is used to store documents in a fixed layout format. XPS documents are similar to PDF documents, but they are not as widely used. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents. It is used to create web content, such as blog posts, and is also used in many text editors. Converting XPS documents to Markdown can make them easier to read and edit.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XPS to Markdown Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a package of APIs that can be used to integrate XPS to MARKDOWN conversion feature in mobile apps. It includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. The first API can be used to convert XPS files to DOC format. The second API can be used to render DOC files to MARKDOWN. This makes it easy to integrate XPS to MARKDOWN conversion feature in mobile apps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XPS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting XPS to MARKDOWN, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a XPS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load XPS document
Document doc = new Document("template.xps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in MARKDOWN document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a MARKDOWN document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.markdown", SaveFormat.MARKDOWN);
