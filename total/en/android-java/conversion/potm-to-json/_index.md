<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Office Theme (POTM) file format is a Microsoft Office file format used to store themes and templates. It is used to store the color scheme, font scheme, effects, background images, and other settings for a document. Converting a POTM file to JSON format can be useful for applications that require the data to be in a more accessible format.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input POTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

While you are converting POTM to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
