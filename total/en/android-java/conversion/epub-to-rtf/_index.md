<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not supported by all devices and applications. RTF, on the other hand, is a widely supported format that can be used to read and edit documents on a variety of platforms. Converting EPUB to RTF allows users to access their e-books on any device or application that supports the RTF format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to RTF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate powerful document processing features into mobile applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert EPUB to RTF: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java.

The first step in the conversion process is to convert the EPUB file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API can be used to convert a variety of document formats, including EPUB, to DOC. Once the EPUB file has been converted to DOC, the Word Processing API, Aspose.Words for Android Java, can be used to render the DOC file to RTF. This API can also be used to perform a variety of other document processing tasks, such as creating, editing, and converting documents.

By using Aspose.Total for Android Java, developers can easily integrate EPUB to RTF conversion into their mobile applications. This will allow users to access their e-books on any device or application that supports the RTF format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get EPUB File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting EPUB to RTF, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a EPUB file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("template.epub");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in RTF document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a RTF document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.rtf", SaveFormat.RTF);
