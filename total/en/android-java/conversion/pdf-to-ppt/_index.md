// open PDF document
Document doc = new Document("input.pdf", "Your@Password");
// save PDF as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.ppt");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
