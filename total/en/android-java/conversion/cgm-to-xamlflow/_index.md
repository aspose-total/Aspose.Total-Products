<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. XAMLFLOW is a markup language used for creating user interfaces for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to XAMLFLOW in order to integrate the CGM file into a mobile application.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to XAMLFLOW Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents in various formats. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert CGM to XAMLFLOW. The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert CGM to DOC. The second API is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC to XAMLFLOW. By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate CGM to XAMLFLOW conversion feature in their mobile apps.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to XAML_FLOW format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set XAML_FLOW as SaveFormat

// save CGM as a DOC 
document.save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.DOC); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
Document outputDocument = new com.aspose.words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.XAML_FLOW

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get CGM File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting CGM to XAMLFLOW, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a CGM file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load CGM document
Document doc = new Document("template.cgm");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in XAMLFLOW document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a XAMLFLOW document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.xaml_flow", SaveFormat.XAML_FLOW);
