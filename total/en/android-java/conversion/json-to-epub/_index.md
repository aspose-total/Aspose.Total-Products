<h2>Why to Convert JSON to EPUB?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. On the other hand, EPUB (Electronic Publication) is a free and open e-book standard by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). It is designed for reflowable content, meaning that the text display can be optimized for the particular display device used by the reader of the e-book.

Converting JSON to EPUB is beneficial for Android applications as it allows them to store and exchange data in a format that is optimized for the particular display device used by the reader. This helps to improve the user experience and make the application more efficient.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to EPUB Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a suite of APIs that helps developers to create, manipulate and convert documents in their Android applications. It includes two powerful APIs, Aspose.Cells for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android via Java, which can be used to convert JSON to EPUB.

The first step of the conversion process is to parse JSON to PDF using Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. This API allows developers to create, manipulate and convert spreadsheets in their Android applications. It supports a wide range of file formats, including PDF, and can be used to parse JSON to PDF.

In the second step, developers can use Aspose.Words for Android via Java to convert PDF to EPUB. This API allows developers to create, manipulate and convert documents in their Android applications. It supports a wide range of file formats, including EPUB, and can be used to convert PDF to EPUB.

By using Aspose.Total for Android via Java, developers can easily convert JSON to EPUB in their Android applications. This helps to improve the user experience and make the application more efficient.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to EPUB format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON format while parsing JSON to EPUB using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to EPUB with Watermark in Android Apps" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to EPUB with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your EPUB document, you can first parse the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to EPUB.
