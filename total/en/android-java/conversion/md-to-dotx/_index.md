<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The MD to DOTX conversion feature is an important tool for mobile app developers. It allows them to integrate a powerful document conversion feature into their apps. This feature can be used to convert Markdown (MD) files into Microsoft Word templates (DOTX). This is useful for creating documents with a consistent look and feel, as well as for quickly creating documents with the same formatting.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to DOTX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate powerful document conversion features into mobile apps. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert MD files to DOTX. The first is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to convert MD files to DOC. The second is Aspose.Words for Android Java, which can be used to render DOC files to DOTX. By using these two APIs together, developers can easily integrate MD to DOTX conversion into their mobile apps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get MD File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting MD to DOTX, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a MD file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load MD document
Document doc = new Document("template.md");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Insert Endnotes in DOTX Document in Android Apps" %}}
Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOTX document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOTX document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dotx", SaveFormat.DOTX);
