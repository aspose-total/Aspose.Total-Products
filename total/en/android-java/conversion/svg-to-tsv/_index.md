<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format that is used to create and display images on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. SVG images are widely used in web design, mobile applications, and print media. However, the SVG format is not compatible with many other applications, such as Microsoft Excel. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG images to a format that is compatible with Excel, such as TSV.
