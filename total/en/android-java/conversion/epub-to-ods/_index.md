<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, and is widely used for digital publications. However, it is not suitable for data analysis and manipulation. The OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) format is a popular open source format for spreadsheets, and is the preferred format for data analysis and manipulation. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to ODS in order to use the data contained in the EPUB file for data analysis and manipulation.
