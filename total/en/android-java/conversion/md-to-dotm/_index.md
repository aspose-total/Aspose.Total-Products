<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

In today's digital world, mobile applications are becoming increasingly popular. To make the most of this trend, developers need to be able to integrate features that allow users to convert files from one format to another. One such conversion is from MD to DOTM, which is used to create Microsoft Word documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to DOTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a package of APIs that can be used to integrate MD to DOTM conversion feature into mobile apps. The package includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The first step in the conversion process is to convert the MD file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a range of features that allow developers to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF files to other formats. 

Once the MD file has been converted to DOC, the second step is to render the DOC to DOTM using Aspose.Words for Android Java. This API provides a range of features for manipulating Word documents, including the ability to convert documents to other formats. 

By using Aspose.Total for Android Java, developers can easily integrate MD to DOTM conversion feature into their mobile apps. This will allow users to easily convert MD files to DOTM, making it easier to create Microsoft Word documents.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MD to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to DOTM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set DOTM as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get MD File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting MD to DOTM, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a MD file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load MD document
Document doc = new Document("template.md");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Insert Endnotes in DOTM Document in Android via Java" %}}
Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOTM document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOTM document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.DOTM);
