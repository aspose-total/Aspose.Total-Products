<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to XAML</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format that is used to save web pages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources such as images, audio, and video. XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) is a declarative XML-based language developed by Microsoft that is used to create user interfaces in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. Converting MHTML to XAML allows developers to create a more interactive user experience in their applications.

```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.xaml");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
