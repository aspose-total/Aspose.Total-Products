You can integrate MHTML to XAML conversion feature inside your Android applications by using two simple steps. In the first step you can export MHTML to PPTX by using [Aspose.PDF for Android via  Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/).  After that, by using [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can convert PPTX to XAML. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) package.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MHTML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Android via Java directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) and install [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/installation/) and [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/install-aspose-slides-for-android-via-java/) in your applications.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/androidjava).

```java
// load MHTML file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.mhtml");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Xaml format
presentation.save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected MHTML File in Android via Java" %}}
While loading MHTML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open MHTML document
Document doc = new Document("input.mhtml", "Your@Password");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of XAML File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting MHTML to XAML, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.xaml");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
```
