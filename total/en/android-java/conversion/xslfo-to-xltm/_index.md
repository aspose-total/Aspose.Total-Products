<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XSLFO to XLTM conversion is a useful process for Android applications. XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics. It is used to describe the formatting of a document, such as a PDF, and is used to generate PDF documents. XLTM (Excel Macro-Enabled Template) is a Microsoft Excel template file format that contains macros and other programming code. It is used to create a template for a spreadsheet that can be used to quickly generate multiple spreadsheets with the same formatting and formulas.
