[Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) allows manipulating file formats within Android applications. By using the APIs provided in the package you can automate PowerPoint PPSM to Word RTF conversion process in your apps. 
You can convert your given document in two steps. You can use [Aspose.Slides for Andorid via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) that is a PowerPoint API for Android applications to render PPSM to HTML. After that by using document processing API [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) you can convert the HTML to RTF.
