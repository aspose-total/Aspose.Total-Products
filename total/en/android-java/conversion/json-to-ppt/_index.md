Converting JSON format to PPT in Android applications can be done in a two-step process. The first step is to use Aspose.Cells for Android via Java to parse the JSON data into a PPTX file. Aspose.Cells for Android via Java is a part of the Aspose.Total for Android via Java package. This package provides a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Slides for Android via Java to convert the PPTX file into a PPT file. Aspose.Slides for Android via Java is also part of the Aspose.Total for Android via Java package. This API provides a wide range of features for creating, editing, and converting presentations. It also supports a variety of formats, including PPT, PPTX, ODP, and PDF. 

By using Aspose.Cells for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java, you can easily convert JSON format to PPT in your Android applications. The APIs are easy to use and provide a comprehensive set of features for manipulating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPT format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to PPT with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PPT with Watermark in Android via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPT with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPT document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to PPT.
