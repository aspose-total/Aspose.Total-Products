<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is often used for archiving and printing. However, PDFs are not always the best format for sharing information. Text files are often easier to work with, and can be used to store data in a more structured way. Converting PDFs to text files can make it easier to work with the data contained within them.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to TXT Conversion</h2>
