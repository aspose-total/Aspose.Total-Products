<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. It is used to create and store images in XML format. On the other hand, OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) is a file format for spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. It is used to store data in a tabular form. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to ODS in order to use the data stored in SVG format in a tabular form.
