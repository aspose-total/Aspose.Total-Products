<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

XML to POTM conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. It allows developers to export XML data into a PowerPoint Open XML Macro-Enabled Presentation (POTM) format. This format is used to create presentations with macros, which can be used to automate tasks and add interactive elements to the presentation.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to POTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate XML to POTM conversion feature into Android applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java. 

The first step is to export XML to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a set of features to create, read, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also supports the conversion of XML to PPTX format. 

The second step is to convert PPTX to POTM by using Aspose.Slides for Android via Java. This API provides a set of features to create, read, edit, and convert presentations. It also supports the conversion of PPTX to POTM format. 

By using Aspose.Total for Android via Java, developers can easily integrate XML to POTM conversion feature into their Android applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to convert XML data into a POTM format, which can be used to create presentations with macros.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XML File in Android Apps" %}}
While loading XML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml", "Your@Password");
// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of POTM File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting XML to POTM, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTM file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.potm");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
