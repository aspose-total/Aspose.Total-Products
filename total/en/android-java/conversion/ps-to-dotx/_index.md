<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its compatibility with most operating systems and devices. However, PDF files are not always suitable for editing. In such cases, it is necessary to convert the PDF file to a different format, such as Microsoft Word's .docx or .dotx formats.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to DOTX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to integrate various features into mobile applications. It includes APIs for PDF, Word Processing, and other document formats. With Aspose.Total, you can easily integrate PS to DOTX conversion feature into your mobile apps.

The process of converting a PS file to DOTX involves two steps. First, you need to convert the PS file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including conversion to other formats. Once the PS file is converted to DOC, you can use the Word Processing API, Aspose.Words for Android Java, to render the DOC to DOTX. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and converting documents.

By using the two APIs of Aspose.Total for Android Java, you can easily integrate PS to DOTX conversion feature into your mobile apps. This will enable you to easily convert PDF files to other formats, such as Microsoft Word's .docx or .dotx formats, for editing and sharing.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PS to DOTX, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load PS document
Document doc = new Document("template.ps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOTX document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOTX document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dotx", SaveFormat.DOTX);
