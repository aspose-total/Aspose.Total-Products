<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
The Markdown (MD) format is a popular text-based markup language used for creating web content. It is a lightweight and easy-to-read syntax for formatting plain text. On the other hand, Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (XLAM) is a Microsoft Excel file format that stores macros, or pieces of code, that can be used to automate tasks in Excel. Converting MD to XLAM allows users to take advantage of the automation capabilities of Excel.
