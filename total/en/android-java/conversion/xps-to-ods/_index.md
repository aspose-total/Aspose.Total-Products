<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XPS to ODS conversion is a necessary process for many Android applications. XPS is a document format developed by Microsoft, while ODS is an open document format developed by the Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF). XPS documents are not compatible with ODS documents, so conversion is necessary in order to use the documents in different applications.
