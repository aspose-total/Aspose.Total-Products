<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XML to POT conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. It allows developers to export XML data into a PPTX file and then convert it into a POT file. This is beneficial for applications that require the data to be presented in a visually appealing format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to POT Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive package that provides developers with the tools they need to integrate XML to POT conversion into their Android applications. The package includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java. 

The first API, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, allows developers to export XML data into a PPTX file. This API provides a range of features that make it easy to create and manipulate PDF documents. It also supports a wide range of file formats, including XML, HTML, and XPS.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XML File in Android Apps" %}}
While loading XML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml", "Your@Password");
// save XML as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of POT File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting XML to POT, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POT file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.pot");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
