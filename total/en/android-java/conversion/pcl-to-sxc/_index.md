<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents, and is often used to store and share documents. However, PDFs are not always the most convenient format for data analysis and manipulation. In such cases, it is often necessary to convert PDFs into other formats, such as Microsoft Excel (XLSX) or OpenOffice Calc (SXC).
