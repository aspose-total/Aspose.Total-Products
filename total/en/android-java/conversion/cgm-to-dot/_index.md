<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used to store and exchange graphics data. It is widely used in the printing and publishing industry. However, it is not supported by many mobile applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to DOT (Drawing Object Technology) format to make it compatible with mobile applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for cgm to dot conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate CGM to DOT conversion feature in their mobile applications. It consists of two APIs, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API allows developers to convert CGM files to DOC format. It supports a wide range of features such as text extraction, image extraction, document conversion, document manipulation, and much more.

The Aspose.Words for Android Java API enables developers to render DOC to DOT format. It provides a wide range of features such as document manipulation, document conversion, text extraction, and much more. It also supports a variety of file formats such as DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML, and more.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate CGM to DOT conversion feature in their mobile applications. It is a simple and efficient way to make CGM files compatible with mobile applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get CGM File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting CGM to DOT, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a CGM file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load CGM document
Document doc = new Document("template.cgm");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOT document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOT document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dot", SaveFormat.DOT);
