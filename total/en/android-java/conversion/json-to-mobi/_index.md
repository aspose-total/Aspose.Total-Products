<h2>Why to Convert JSON to MOBI</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format and is easy for humans to read and write. MOBI is a file format used to store e-books and other digital publications. It is a proprietary format developed by Amazon and is used to store e-books for the Kindle e-reader. Converting JSON to MOBI allows users to read their data on Kindle devices.
