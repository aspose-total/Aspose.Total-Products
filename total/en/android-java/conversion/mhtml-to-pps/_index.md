<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format that combines resources such as images, audio, and video into a single file. It is used to save webpages for offline viewing and is supported by most web browsers. On the other hand, PPS (PowerPoint Show) is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is used to display a presentation in a self-running slide show. Therefore, if you want to display a presentation in a self-running slide show, you need to convert MHTML to PPS.
