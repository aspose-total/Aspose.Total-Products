<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert PostScript (PS) files to XAMLFLOW arises when you want to integrate the feature of PS to XAMLFLOW conversion in your mobile apps. XAMLFLOW is a markup language used to create documents with a fixed layout, such as PDFs, and is widely used in the mobile app development industry.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for PS to XAMLFLOW Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate the feature of PS to XAMLFLOW conversion in your mobile apps. It consists of two APIs, namely Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java.

The second step is to render the DOC file to XAMLFLOW using Aspose.Words for Android Java. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating Word documents, such as creating, editing, and converting Word documents to other formats. It also supports rendering Word documents to XAMLFLOW, which makes it ideal for integrating the feature of PS to XAMLFLOW conversion in your mobile apps.

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for Android Java is an ideal package for integrating the feature of PS to XAMLFLOW conversion in your mobile apps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get PS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting PS to XAMLFLOW, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a PS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load PS document
Document doc = new Document("template.ps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Insert Endnotes in XAMLFLOW Document in Android via Java" %}}
Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in XAMLFLOW document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a XAMLFLOW document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.xaml_flow", SaveFormat.XAML_FLOW);
