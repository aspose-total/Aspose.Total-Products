<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to XAML?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for formatting XML documents. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting information. XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) is a declarative XML-based language developed by Microsoft that is used to create user interfaces and define objects and their properties. It is used to create applications for Windows, the web, and mobile devices. Converting XSLFO to XAML allows developers to create applications for multiple platforms using a single codebase.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XSLFO to XAML Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents, images, and other file formats. It includes Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Slides for Android via Java, which can be used to convert XSLFO to XAML. To do this, the XSLFO document must first be exported to PPTX using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. Then, Aspose.Slides for Android via Java can be used to convert the PPTX to XAML. This two-step process is simple and efficient, allowing developers to quickly and easily integrate XSLFO to XAML conversion into their Android applications.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-int-) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

```java
// load XSLFO file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.xslfo");
// save XSLFO as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Xaml format
presentation.save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected XSLFO File in Android via Java" %}}
While loading XSLFO file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open XSLFO document
Document doc = new Document("input.xslfo", "Your@Password");
// save XSLFO as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of XAML File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting XSLFO to XAML, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.xaml");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
```
