<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to POTX?</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint. To make the content of an EPUB book available in PowerPoint, it must be converted to the POTX format. This allows users to view the content of the book in a presentation format, which can be used for educational or business purposes.
