<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used to store and exchange graphics data. It is widely used in the printing industry, but is not suitable for use in Android applications. XLSB (Excel Binary) is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel. It is a compressed version of the XLSX format and is used to reduce the size of the file and improve performance. Converting CGM to XLSB allows Android applications to use the data stored in CGM files.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to XLSB Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate powerful document processing features into their Android applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert CGM to XLSB: Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. 

Using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, developers can convert CGM to XLSX. This API provides a range of features for working with PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF files to other formats. Once the CGM file has been converted to XLSX, Aspose.Cells for Android via Java can be used to convert the XLSX file to XLSB. This API provides a range of features for working with spreadsheets, including the ability to convert between different spreadsheet formats. 

By using these two APIs, developers can easily integrate CGM to XLSB conversion into their Android applications in a two-step process. This makes it easy to use the data stored in CGM files in Android applications.
