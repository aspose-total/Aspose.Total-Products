You can convert JSON format to POTX in your Android applications in a two-step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Cells for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/android-java/), you can parse JSON to PPTX. After that, by using [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can convert PPTX to POTX. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) package.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and open JSON file 
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with Android via Java APIs" %}}
You can easily use Aspose.Total for Android via Java directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) and install libraries in your app.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/androidjava).

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to POTX with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to POTX with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POTX document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to POTX.
