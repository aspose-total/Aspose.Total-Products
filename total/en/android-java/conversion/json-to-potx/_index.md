<h2>Why to Convert JSON to POTX?</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between different applications. It is a text-based, human-readable format that is used to represent simple data structures and objects. POTX (PowerPoint Open XML) is a file format used to store presentations in Microsoft PowerPoint. It is an XML-based format that is used to store slides, text, images, and other objects. Converting JSON to POTX allows you to view and edit the data in a PowerPoint presentation.

Furthermore, the API allows you to parse JSON to POTX with specified layout options. In order to specify the layout options, you can use [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions) class. It allows you to process an array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to POTX with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POTX document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class, loop through all slides, add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to POTX.
