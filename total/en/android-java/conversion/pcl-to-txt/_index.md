<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is often used for archiving and printing. However, PDF files are not always the most convenient format for editing or sharing. Text files, on the other hand, are more versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes. Converting PDF files to text files can make them easier to work with and share.
