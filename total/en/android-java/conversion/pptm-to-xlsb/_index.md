<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The PPTM file format is a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation file that is used to store presentations. It is a combination of the PPT and PPTX formats, and is used to store presentations that contain macros. The XLSB file format is a Microsoft Excel binary workbook file that is used to store spreadsheet data. It is a compressed version of the XLSX format and is used to store large amounts of data in a smaller file size. Converting a PPTM file to XLSB can be useful for sharing data between different applications or for archiving data.
