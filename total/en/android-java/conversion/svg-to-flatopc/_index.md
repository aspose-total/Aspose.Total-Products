<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format, which is used to create and display vector graphics on the web. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics, with support for interactivity and animation. However, the FLATOPC format is a proprietary format used by Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. It is used to store documents in a compressed, binary format. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to FLATOPC in order to use the vector graphics in Microsoft Office applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for svg to flatopc conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the ability to create, edit, and convert documents in various formats. It includes APIs for PDF, Word Processing, and other document formats. With Aspose.Total, developers can easily integrate SVG to FLATOPC conversion feature in their mobile apps.

The process of converting SVG to FLATOPC involves two steps. First, the SVG file needs to be converted to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a wide range of features for creating, editing, and converting PDF documents. Secondly, the Word Processing API, Aspose.Words for Android Java, can be used to render DOC to FLATOPC. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and converting Word documents.

By using Aspose.Total for Android Java, developers can easily integrate SVG to FLATOPC conversion feature in their mobile apps. This will enable them to use vector graphics in Microsoft Office applications.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to FLAT_OPC format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set FLAT_OPC as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get SVG File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting SVG to FLATOPC, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a SVG file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load SVG document
Document doc = new Document("template.svg");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in FLATOPC document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a FLATOPC document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.flat_opc", SaveFormat.FLAT_OPC);
