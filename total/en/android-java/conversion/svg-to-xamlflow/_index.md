<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a widely used vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. It is used to create and display images on the web. However, XAMLFLOW is a markup language used to create user interfaces for Windows applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to XAMLFLOW in order to use the images in Windows applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for svg to xamlflow conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate SVG to XAMLFLOW conversion feature in mobile apps. It consists of two APIs, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The Aspose.PDF for Android via Java API can be used to convert SVG file to DOC. It is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their own applications. It supports a wide range of file formats, including SVG, and can be used to convert SVG to DOC.

The Aspose.Words for Android Java API can be used to render DOC to XAMLFLOW. It is a powerful Word Processing API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print Word documents from within their own applications. It supports a wide range of file formats, including DOC, and can be used to convert DOC to XAMLFLOW.

By using these two APIs of Aspose.Total for Android Java package, developers can easily integrate SVG to XAMLFLOW conversion feature in their mobile apps. This will enable them to use SVG images in Windows applications.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class of Aspose.Words  
4. Save the document to XAML_FLOW format using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set XAML_FLOW as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get SVG File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting SVG to XAMLFLOW, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a SVG file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load SVG document
Document doc = new Document("template.svg");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in XAMLFLOW document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a XAMLFLOW document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.xaml_flow", SaveFormat.XAML_FLOW);
