<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is often used for business and legal documents. However, the PDF format is not suitable for presentations, as it does not support animations, transitions, and other features that are commonly used in presentations. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF documents to PowerPoint (PPT) or PowerPoint Template (POT) formats in order to create presentations.
