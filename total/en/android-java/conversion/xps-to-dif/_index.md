<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XPS to DIF conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. XPS is a fixed-layout document format that is used to store documents in a way that is independent of application software, hardware, and operating system. DIF is a data interchange format used to exchange data between different applications. By converting XPS to DIF, users can easily exchange data between different applications.
