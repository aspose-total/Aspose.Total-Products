```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POT file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.pot");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
