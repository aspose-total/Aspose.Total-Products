<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TEX to PPSX conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. It allows users to export TEX documents to PPSX format, which is a presentation format that is supported by Microsoft PowerPoint. This conversion is useful for creating presentations from TEX documents, as well as for sharing documents with others who may not have access to the original TEX document.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to PPSX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive package that includes two APIs that can be used to convert TEX to PPSX. The first API is Aspose.PDF for Android via Java, which can be used to export TEX documents to PPTX format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Open Password Protected TEX File in Android Apps" %}}
While loading TEX file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/android-java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// open TEX document
Document doc = new Document("input.tex", "Your@Password");
// save TEX as PPTX format 
document.save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Thumbnail Image of PPSX File in Android Applications" %}}
After converting TEX to PPSX, you can also create thumbnail images of your output document. By using rich in feature [Aspose.Slides for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/) you can generate thumbnail images of the slides by creating and instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class. After that, you can obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index and get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("output.ppsx");
// access the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// create a full scale image
BufferedImage image = sld.getThumbnail(1f, 1f);
 // save the image to disk in PNG format
ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new java.io.File("Thumbnail_out.png"));
