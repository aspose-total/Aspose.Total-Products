<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to CSV?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language used to define the formatting of a document. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting details. On the other hand, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a plain text format used for storing tabular data. It is used to store data in a tabular format, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field. Converting XSLFO to CSV allows users to store and manipulate tabular data in a more efficient way.
