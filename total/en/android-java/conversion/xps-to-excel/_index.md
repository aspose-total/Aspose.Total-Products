<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XPS to EXCEL conversion is a useful feature for Android applications. It allows users to convert XPS documents into the EXCEL format, which is a widely used spreadsheet format. This conversion process can be used to create reports, analyze data, and perform other tasks.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XPS to Excel Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a powerful suite of APIs that can be used to convert XPS documents to EXCEL. The two-step process involves using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java to convert XPS to XLSX, and then using Aspose.Cells for Android via Java to convert XLSX to EXCEL. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for Android via Java product family. This makes it easy to integrate XPS to EXCEL conversion into Android applications.
