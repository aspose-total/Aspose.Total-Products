<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The SVG to XLSB conversion feature is a useful tool for Android developers who need to integrate the ability to convert SVG files into XLSB files within their applications. XLSB files are a binary version of the XLSX file format, and are more compact and efficient than the XLSX format. This makes them ideal for applications that require a large number of files to be stored and accessed quickly.
