<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XPS to DOT conversion is a useful feature for mobile apps. XPS is a fixed-layout document format that is used to store documents in a way that is independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system. DOT is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. Converting XPS to DOT allows users to open and edit documents in Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XPS to DOT Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Android Java is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to integrate XPS to DOT conversion feature in mobile apps. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for Android via Java and Aspose.Words for Android Java. 

The first step is to convert XPS file to DOC using Aspose.PDF for Android via Java. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including converting PDF to other formats. It also supports XPS to PDF conversion. Once the XPS file is converted to PDF, it can be converted to DOC using the same API.

The second step is to render DOC to DOT using Aspose.Words for Android Java. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate Word documents, including converting DOC to other formats. It also supports DOC to DOT conversion.

By using Aspose.Total for Android Java package, developers can easily integrate XPS to DOT conversion feature in their mobile apps. It is a cost-effective solution that can be used to convert XPS files to DOT format quickly and accurately.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XPS File Information on Android via Java" %}}
Before converting XPS to DOT, you might need information about the document including author, creation date, keywords, modify date, subject, and title. This information is helpful for the decision making for the conversion process. Using the powerful [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/androidjava/) API, you can get all of it. To get file-specific information about a XPS file, first get the [DocumentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/DocumentInfo) object using [getInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#getInfo--) method. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load XPS document
Document doc = new Document("template.xps");
// get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = doc.getInfo();
// show document information
System.out.println("Author: " + docInfo.getAuthor());
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + docInfo.getCreationDate());
System.out.println("Keywords: " + docInfo.getKeywords());
System.out.println("Modify Date: " + docInfo.getModDate());
System.out.println("Subject: " + docInfo.getSubject());
System.out.println("Title: " + docInfo.getTitle());
```

Apart from document conversion, you can also add a bunch of other features inside your Android Applications using [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/androidjava/) API. One of that feature is inserting endnotes and numbering in DOT document. If you want to insert a footnote or an endnote in a DOT document, please use DocumentBuilder.InsertFootnote method. This method inserts a footnote or endnote into the document. EndnoteOptions and FootnoteOptions classes represent numbering options for footnote and endnote. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```java
// load document
Document doc = new Document("input.DOC");
// initialize document builder
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
// add text in it
builder.write("Some text");
// insert footnote
builder.insertFootnote(FootnoteType.ENDNOTE, "Endnote text.");
// initialize endnote options
EndnoteOptions option = doc.getEndnoteOptions();
// set restart rule
option.setRestartRule(FootnoteNumberingRule.RESTART_PAGE);
// set position
option.setPosition(EndnotePosition.END_OF_SECTION);
// save the document to disk.
doc.save("output.dot", SaveFormat.DOT);
