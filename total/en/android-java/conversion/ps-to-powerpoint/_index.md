It is widely used for sharing documents, as it is compatible with most operating systems and devices. However, PDFs are not ideal for presentations, as they are not as visually appealing as PowerPoint presentations. Converting PDFs to PowerPoint presentations allows users to create more engaging and visually appealing presentations.
