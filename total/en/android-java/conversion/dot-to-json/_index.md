<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOT format is a text-based file format used for representing graphs. It is used for representing structural information such as graphs, networks, and diagrams. It is a popular format for representing data in a structured way. However, it is not suitable for use in Android applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert DOT to JSON format for use in Android applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for dot to json conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Android via Java is a comprehensive suite of document manipulation and conversion APIs that can be used to convert DOT to JSON format in Android applications. It includes the Aspose.Words for Android via Java API, which can be used to export DOT to HTML. The Aspose.Cells for Android via Java API can then be used to convert HTML to JSON. This makes it easy to convert DOT to JSON format in Android applications.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input DOT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how open an encrypted document with a password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert DOT to JSON in Range in Android via Java" %}}
While you are converting DOT to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method, call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions and write string JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method.
