<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular file format used for documents that require a high degree of accuracy and portability. It is widely used for business documents, legal documents, and other documents that need to be shared across different platforms. However, PDF files are not always the best choice for data analysis. The Tab Separated Values (TSV) format is a better choice for data analysis because it is easier to read and manipulate.
