For a Python developer, who is trying to add a XLT to PNG, BMP, TIFF, JPEG and GIF Image conversion feature within application. As sometimes it's required to embed Excel spreadsheets in the web or desktop applications. In such cases exporting spreadsheets to images is the one soultion. [Aspose.Total for Python via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-java/) API can help to export Excel files to images as well as to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Microsoft Excel formats via its child [Aspose.Cells for Python via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-java/) API.

- Create [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-java/asposecells.api/Workbook) class object to load XLT file
- Use [ImageOrPrintOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-java/asposecells.api/ImageOrPrintOptions) class and specify the output image relevant options
- Get the access the worksheet for conversion using [Workbook.getWorksheets().get(index)](https://reference.aspose.com//cells/python-java/asposecells.api/worksheetcollection#Item%20(int)) method
- Create the instance of [SheetRender](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/SheetRender) class object and initialize it with Worksheet and ImageOrPrintOptions objects
- Save all pages of worksheet as an image using [SheetRender.toImage(pageIndex, fileName)](https://reference.aspose.com//cells/python-java/asposecells.api/sheetrender#toImage(int,%20java.lang.String)) method. Now XLT file is converted to Images at the specified path
