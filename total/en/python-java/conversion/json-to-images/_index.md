- Create [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-java/asposecells.api/Workbook) class object to load JSON file
- Use [ImageOrPrintOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-java/asposecells.api/ImageOrPrintOptions) class and specify the output image relevant options
- Get the access the worksheet for conversion using [Workbook.getWorksheets().get(index)](https://reference.aspose.com//cells/python-java/asposecells.api/worksheetcollection#Item%20(int)) method
- Create the instance of [SheetRender](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/SheetRender) class object and initialize it with Worksheet and ImageOrPrintOptions objects
- Save all pages of worksheet as an image using [SheetRender.toImage(pageIndex, fileName)](https://reference.aspose.com//cells/python-java/asposecells.api/sheetrender#toImage(int,%20java.lang.String)) method. Now JSON file is converted to Images at the specified path
