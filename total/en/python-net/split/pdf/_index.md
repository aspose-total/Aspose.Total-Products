PDF files are widely used for fixed-layout documents where content is distributed across pages. Splitting PDFs enables page-level or section-level access without modifying the original file.



Python-driven PDF splitting enhances automation by enabling large-scale processing, selective extraction, and integration with document pipelines.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Page-Level Extraction**  &nbsp; Isolate specific pages for review or distribution.



* **Document Segmentation**  &nbsp; Split large PDFs into logical sections.



* **Compliance and Audit Handling**  &nbsp; Extract relevant portions for verification.
