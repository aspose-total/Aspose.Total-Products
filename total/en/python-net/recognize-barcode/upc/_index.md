For a developer, who is trying to scan custom UPC barcode images via Python application, [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the barcode reading and recognition process in any color or size according to business needs. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats as well as 1D, 2D and Postal barcodes. [Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/python-net/) API that is part of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package makes this scanning process easy. Moreover, developers can adjust the parameters of the recognition engine to enable fast barcode scanning or improve reading accuracy.

- Use BarCodeReader class object with DecodeType.AllSupportedTypes as parameter
- By calling read_bar_codes() to get all the UPC code
- Iterate through all result to print it

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Recognition Requirements" %}}

- For UPC Barcode scanning, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.BarCode](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-barcode-for-python-via-net/)) 
- Or Use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-barcode-for-python-via-net``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [BarCode](https://docs.aspose.com/barcode/python-net/system-requirements/))
