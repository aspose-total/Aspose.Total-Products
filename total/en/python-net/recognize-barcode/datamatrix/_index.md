<h2 class="heading-border">How Data Matrix Barcode Scanning can help Python Apps?</h2>

Data Matrix barcode scanning is valuable for Python apps as it enables efficient data retrieval and automation. It simplifies tasks such as inventory management, product tracking, and document management by quickly and accurately extracting information from Data Matrix barcodes, improving data accuracy, and streamlining workflows in various applications.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in Data Matrix Barcode Scanning?</h2>

For developers seeking to scan custom Data Matrix barcode images within Python applications, the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API offers an efficient solution. This comprehensive API package covers various formats, including 1D, 2D, and Postal barcodes, while accommodating barcodes of different colors and sizes to suit specific business needs. In particular, the Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET API, part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package, simplifies the scanning process. Developers can fine-tune recognition engine parameters to achieve fast barcode scanning or enhance reading accuracy, tailoring the solution to their requirements. This approach streamlines the entire barcode recognition process within Python applications.

- Use BarCodeReader class object with DecodeType.AllSupportedTypes as parameter
- By calling read_bar_codes() to get all the Data Matrix code
- Iterate through all result to print it

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Data Matrix Recognition Requirements" %}}

- For Data Matrix Barcode scanning, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.BarCode](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-barcode-for-python-via-net/)) 
- Or Use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-barcode-for-python-via-net``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [BarCode](https://docs.aspose.com/barcode/python-net/system-requirements/))
