For a developer, who is trying to generate custom CODE39 barcode images via Python application, [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the barcode creation process in any color or size according to business needs. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats as well as 1D, 2D and Postal barcodes. [Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/python-net/) API that is part of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package makes this generation process easy.
