Document redaction is the process of editing or preparing a document to remove or obscure sensitive, confidential, or private information. Redaction ensures that certain portions of a document are no longer visible or readable, protecting sensitive content from unauthorized access or disclosure. Redaction is commonly employed in legal, government, healthcare, and corporate environments where document confidentiality is critical.<br />

Document redaction involves the careful removal or obscuring of sensitive information including Text, Image or Metadata within a document to protect privacy, confidentiality, or compliance with regulations. It can be manual or automated redaction by considering the challanges like complete removal, consistency or document integrity by ensuring that redaction does not compromise the overall integrity or context of the remaining content.

Manual redaction in Word has limitations, and for scenarios with a high need for security, compliance, or complex redaction requirements, using specialized redaction software is advisable. Always thoroughly review redacted documents to ensure the complete removal of sensitive information and maintain document integrity. <br />
