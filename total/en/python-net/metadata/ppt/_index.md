Document metadata extraction for **PPT** files via Python APIs enables management of legacy presentation assets by reading properties such as author, timestamps, and descriptive fields. This supports governance and discoverability for organizations that still maintain older slide libraries.



In automated workflows, PPT metadata can power classification, indexing, and lifecycle controls—allowing large collections of legacy presentations to be organized, audited, and migrated with minimal manual effort.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Legacy Slide Library Audit**

  Extract PPT metadata to understand age, ownership, and maintenance gaps across archived decks.



* **Migration Readiness Assessment**

  Use metadata to prioritize which PPT decks should be converted or refreshed first.



* **Ownership-Based Maintenance Routing**

  Identify maintainers from author/editor fields to route update requests efficiently.



* **Content Portfolio Analytics**

  Aggregate PPT metadata to measure library coverage, staleness, and operational risk.



* **Duplicate Asset Detection**

  Use metadata patterns to detect likely duplicates and reduce library clutter.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}



* **Legacy Deck Ingestion Pipeline**

  Automatically ingest PPT files, extract metadata, and assign them to an inventory system with standardized fields.



* **Conversion Queue Automation**

  Add PPT decks to conversion queues based on metadata age and usage classification rules.



* **Stale Deck Notification Workflow**

  Trigger alerts when PPT metadata indicates long periods without updates or missing ownership fields.



* **Automated Library Cleanup Jobs**

  Periodically scan PPT repositories and quarantine assets identified as duplicates or unmanaged based on metadata.
