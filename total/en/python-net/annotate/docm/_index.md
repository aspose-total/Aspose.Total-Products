# ✅ Informational paragraphs + two columns lists (replaces the prose inside feature-section)
about:
  paragraphs:
    - DOCM annotation allows adding notes, highlights, and metadata to macro-enabled Word documents, supporting workflows that require dynamic scripting or embedded automation. This helps users document logic, track changes, and maintain clarity around macro behaviors.
    - By annotating DOCM files programmatically, automation systems can monitor macro usage, enhance documentation consistency, and streamline validation processes.
  columns:
    - title: Key Use Cases
      bullets:
        - "**Macro Documentation** — Label and describe macro-driven actions inside the document."
        - "**Compliance Tracking** — Add notes confirming required scripts or validations."
        - "**Change Logging** — Highlight macro-related updates for visibility."
    - title: Automation Scenarios
      bullets:
        - "**Macro Scan and Annotate** — Automatically insert comments describing detected macro functions."
        - "**Dynamic Compliance Reports** — Populate annotations when macros meet or fail certain checks."
        - "**Script-Based Review Tools** — Use Python to apply structured annotation at scale."

# ✅ FAQs (replaces hardcoded HTML + inline style)
faq:
  - q: Can I use above Python code in my application?
    a: Yes, you are welcome to download this code and utilize it for the purpose of developing Python-based document annotation application. This code can serve as a valuable resource to enhance the functionality and capabilities of your projects in the domain of backend document processing and manipulation.
  - q: Is this online document annotation app work only on Windows?
    a: You have the flexibility to initiate document annotation for comments removal at any device, irrespective of the operating system it runs on, whether it be Windows, Linux, Mac OS, or Android. All that's required is a contemporary web browser and an active internet connection.
  - q: Is it safe to use the online app to annotate DOCM document?
    a: Of course! The output files generated through our service will be securely and automatically removed from our servers within a 24-hour timeframe. As a result, the display links associated with these files will cease to be functional after this period.
  - q: What browser should to use App?
    a: You can use any modern web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Safari for online DOCM document annotation. However, if you're developing a desktop application, we recommend using the Aspose.Total document processing API for efficient management.
