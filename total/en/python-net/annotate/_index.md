Document annotation refers to the process of adding metadata or labels to a document to make its content more understandable, searchable, and analyzable. This can involve manually or automatically highlighting specific elements, such as entities, concepts, or relationships within a text document, image, or other types of content.<br />

Document annotation is commonly used in various fields, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval. The annotations can take different forms depending on the type of information being highlighted and the purpose of the annotation.
