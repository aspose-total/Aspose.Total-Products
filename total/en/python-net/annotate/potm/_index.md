POTM annotation improves macro-enabled presentation templates by adding notes that clarify slide logic, layout instructions, and macro behavior. This enhances template usability and ensures consistent presentation generation.  

Automating POTM annotation makes it easier to track macro usage, enforce layout policies, and update guidance programmatically.
