PDF files are often locked to protect sensitive information, but controlled unlocking is essential for automation, analysis, and lawful reuse. Programmatic access ensures that protected PDFs can still participate in modern digital workflows.



Python APIs allow PDF unlocking to be handled securely and at scale, integrating with data extraction, indexing, and transformation systems.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Text and Data Extraction**  &nbsp; Enables access to protected content for analytics and reporting.



* **Document Review Automation**  &nbsp; Supports automated inspection of locked files during review cycles.



* **Format Conversion Pipelines**  &nbsp; Allows secured PDFs to be converted into editable or searchable formats.
