Generic steps to add digital signatures.  
- You need to initialize the chosen Aspose API in your Python project. This typically involves installing the relevant Aspose library and importing it into your code. 
- Load the document that you want to sign into your Python application using the Aspose API. This may involve specifying the file path or reading the document from a stream.
- Configure the digital signature properties, such as the signing certificate, signature location, appearance, and any additional options based on your requirements. You will typically need a digital certificate for signing.
- Use the Aspose API methods to apply the digital signature to the document. This process will apply the signature based on the configuration you provided in the previous step.
- After applying the digital signature, save the modified document to a file or stream.
