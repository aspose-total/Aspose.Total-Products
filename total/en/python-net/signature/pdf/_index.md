PDF signing with Python APIs provides strong integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation guarantees for finalized documents. This is critical for external sharing and regulated workflows.



Automated PDF signing ensures documents are cryptographically sealed at the exact moment a process completes.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Legal Document Certification**  &nbsp; Digitally sign PDFs to ensure authenticity.



* **Invoice and Financial Approval**  &nbsp; Apply signatures to approved financial documents.



* **Compliance Documentation Finalization**  &nbsp; Seal PDFs used in audits or reporting.
