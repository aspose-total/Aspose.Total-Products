We use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/), a child API of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) for specific tasks related to document content retrieval and searching. The following code snippet perform text replacements and search operations within a Microsoft Word documents. It follows the steps, firstly loads the document and creates a document builder for potential content manipulation. Then, it performs two text replacement operations: one for replacing instances of "CustomerName" with "James Bond" throughout the document and another using a regular expression to replace occurrences of "sad" or "mad" with "bad." Finally, the modified document is saved with the changes applied. Moreover, Python search API also supports [PDF document search](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/search/pdf/) and other formats as well.
