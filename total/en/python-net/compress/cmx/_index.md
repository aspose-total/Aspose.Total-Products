CMX compression reduces the size of Corel Presentation Exchange vector graphics, which often include detailed illustrations, layers, and color profiles. Optimizing CMX files helps improve performance in design workflows, accelerates sharing, and reduces storage requirements across creative and technical environments.



Python APIs enable automated CMX compression and conversion, ensuring efficient handling of large vector assets at scale for publishing, printing, and graphic management systems.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Design Project Optimization**  &nbsp; Compresses layered CMX graphics to streamline file handling and reduce storage impact.



* **Publishing \& Print Pipelines**  &nbsp; Smaller CMX files speed up rendering, editing, and transfer processes.



* **Asset Library Management**  &nbsp; Optimized CMX collections load faster inside digital asset repositories.



* **Cross-Platform Exchange**  &nbsp; Compressed CMX files transfer more efficiently between design teams or applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}



* **Bulk CMX Compression**  &nbsp; Automatically optimize large sets of CMX graphics with Python workflows.



* **CMX-to-Compressed-Format Conversion**  &nbsp; Convert CMX into SVG, PDF, PNG, or EPS while applying compression rules.



* **Automated Upload Optimization**  &nbsp; CMX files can be compressed instantly when ingested into DMS or DAM systems.



* **Content-Aware Compression**  &nbsp; Adjusts optimization intensity based on vector complexity or embedded components.
