PDF compression reduces the size of Portable Document Format files while preserving text, images, fonts, and vector graphics. Compressed PDFs improve storage efficiency, faster sharing, and optimized rendering across devices and platforms.



Python APIs enable automated PDF compression, batch processing, and workflow integration for scalable document management, archival, and distribution.
