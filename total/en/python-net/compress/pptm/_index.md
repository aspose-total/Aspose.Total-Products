PPTM files (macro-enabled presentations) benefit from compression that preserves macros while reducing file size for sharing and storage.



Python APIs allow automated PPTM compression while maintaining macro functionality for enterprise workflows.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Macro Preservation**  &nbsp; Compress PPTM files without breaking embedded macros.



* **Faster Collaboration**  &nbsp; Smaller macro-enabled files facilitate team sharing and cloud uploads.



* **Automated Archival**  &nbsp; Compression ensures efficient long-term storage of presentations with macros.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}



* **Batch PPTM Compression**  &nbsp; Python scripts can process multiple macro-enabled files automatically.



* **Integration with Workflow Systems**  &nbsp; Compressed PPTM files can be used in automated document workflows.



* **Conditional Compression**  &nbsp; Automation can target files with large media or complex macros.
