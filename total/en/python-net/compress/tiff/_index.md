TIFF compression focuses on reducing the size of high-resolution raster images while preserving image quality, color depth, and metadata. TIFF files are widely used in professional photography, printing, and scanning workflows, making compression essential for storage efficiency and faster processing.



Python APIs enable automated TIFF compression, batch processing, and format conversion, allowing scalable handling of large image collections and integration into digital asset management and imaging pipelines.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Professional Photography Storage**  &nbsp; Compressing TIFF files reduces storage costs while retaining high-quality images.



* **Printing and Publishing Workflows**  &nbsp; Optimized TIFFs load faster and process efficiently in prepress and production pipelines.



* **Scanning and Archival**  &nbsp; Compressed TIFFs minimize storage footprint for scanned documents and historical records.



* **Digital Asset Management**  &nbsp; Smaller TIFFs improve retrieval speed and system performance for large image libraries.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}



* **Batch TIFF Compression**  &nbsp; Python scripts can optimize hundreds of TIFF files automatically.



* **Lossless or Controlled Lossy Compression**  &nbsp; Automate selection of compression type based on workflow needs or image content.



* **Workflow Integration**  &nbsp; Compress TIFF files dynamically when uploaded to DAM, CMS, or cloud storage.



* **Resolution-Based Optimization**  &nbsp; Adjust compression levels automatically depending on image dimensions or DPI.
