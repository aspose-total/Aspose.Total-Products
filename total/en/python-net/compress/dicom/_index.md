DICOM compression focuses on optimizing medical imaging files that contain diagnostic images, metadata, and patient information. Because DICOM files are often large due to high-resolution scans, compression is vital for faster transmission, reduced storage costs, and efficient handling within healthcare systems.



Python APIs allow automated DICOM compression, including lossless and controlled lossy methods, ensuring medical imaging workflows remain scalable, reliable, and compliant with clinical standards.



{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Key Use Cases" %}}



* **Medical Imaging Storage Optimization**  &nbsp; Compressing DICOM files reduces the load on PACS systems and long-term archives.



* **Faster Image Transmission**  &nbsp; Smaller files improve transfer speed between hospitals, imaging centers, and cloud systems.



* **Research \& Analytics Pipelines**  &nbsp; Compressed datasets streamline AI model training and large-scale medical image processing.



* **Telemedicine Workflows**  &nbsp; Compression enables quicker delivery of diagnostic visuals to remote healthcare providers.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Automation Scenarios" %}}



* **Batch Compression of Diagnostic Images**  &nbsp; Automates size reduction for large MRI, CT, and X-ray libraries.



* **Dynamic Lossless/Lossy Selection**  &nbsp; Automation chooses compression type based on modality, resolution, or clinical requirements.



* **Workflow-Integrated Optimization**  &nbsp; Compresses DICOM files during ingestion into PACS, RIS, or cloud imaging systems.



* **Metadata-Preserved Compression**  &nbsp; Automated processes maintain all medical tags and identifiers while reducing file size.
