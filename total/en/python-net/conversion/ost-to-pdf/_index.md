Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that can help Python developers automate the process of converting OST to PDF. It is a comprehensive package that includes APIs for dealing with different formats such as Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API and saved into the respective Word PDF format. This API package makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers. It is a reliable and secure solution that can be used to quickly and accurately convert OST to PDF.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OST is converted

- For OST to PDF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
