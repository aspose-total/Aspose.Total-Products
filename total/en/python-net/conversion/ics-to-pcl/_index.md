<h2>Why to Convert ICS to PCL?</h2>

ICS (iCalendar) is a widely used format for exchanging calendar information between different applications and services. It is used to store events, to-do lists, and other calendar-related information. PCL (Portable Calendar Language) is a format used by Microsoft Outlook to store calendar information. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert ICS to PCL in order to use the calendar information in Microsoft Outlook.

- For ICS to PCL conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
