Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting OFT to DOC. It includes the Aspose.Words and Aspose.Email APIs, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: first, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using the Aspose.Email API, and then the HTML is loaded using the Aspose.Words API and saved into the DOC format. This package is ideal for developers who need to quickly and easily convert OFT to DOC without having to manually code the conversion process.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted

- For OFT to DOC conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
