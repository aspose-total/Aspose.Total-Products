<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to JPEG?</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail, the default email client for Mac OS X. It is a plain text file that contains the email message and its attachments. On the other hand, JPEG is a popular image format used for storing and displaying digital images. Converting EMLX to JPEG can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as for archiving emails, displaying emails in a web page, or for sharing emails with others.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for EMLX to JPEG Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting EMLX to JPEG. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, which make it easy to convert EMLX to JPEG using Python. The process involves two steps: first, the EMLX file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and then the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective JPEG format. This makes it easy to convert EMLX to JPEG with just a few lines of code.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMLX to JPEG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
