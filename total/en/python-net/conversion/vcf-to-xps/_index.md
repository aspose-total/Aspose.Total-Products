<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

VCF (Virtual Contact File) is a file format used to store contact information such as name, address, phone number, email address, etc. It is widely used in email clients and other applications. XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a document format developed by Microsoft for printing and viewing documents. It is similar to PDF but is more secure and can be used to store documents in a more secure way. Therefore, it is necessary to convert VCF to XPS format for secure storage and printing of contact information.
