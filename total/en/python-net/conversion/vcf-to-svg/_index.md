<h2>Why to Convert VCF to SVG?</h2>

VCF (Virtual Contact File) is a file format used to store contact information such as name, address, phone number, email address, etc. It is widely used by many applications and services to store contact information. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web graphics and other applications. Converting VCF to SVG allows users to view contact information in a more visually appealing format.
