<h2>Why to Convert XLS to WordML</h2>

XLS files are widely used for storing tabular data. It is a popular format for data analysis and reporting. However, when it comes to sharing the data with others, XLS files are not always the best option. WordML is a more versatile format that can be used to create documents with complex formatting and layout. It is also easier to share with others, as it can be opened in any word processing application. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert XLS files to WordML.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XLS to WordML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help developers automate the process of converting XLS files to WordML. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats, including XLS and WordML. The conversion process is done in two steps. Firstly, the XLS file is converted to HTML using the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API. Then, the HTML is saved into the desired Microsoft Word format using the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API. This makes it easy to convert XLS files to WordML quickly and efficiently.

- **Step 1** Open the source XLS file using Workbook class
- Save XLS file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output WORDML file path. So your XLS file is converted to WORDML at the specified path
