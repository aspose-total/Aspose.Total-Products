<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OST to IMAGE conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. OST files are Outlook data files that contain emails, contacts, calendar items, and other data from an Outlook account. These files are used to store data locally on a computer, and they can be used to transfer data between computers. IMAGE files, on the other hand, are image files that contain a single image or a collection of images. IMAGE files are used to store and share images, and they can be used to create digital artwork. Converting OST files to IMAGE files can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as creating digital artwork or sharing images with others.

- Open the source OST file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OST is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OST to IMAGE conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
