<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert documents from one format to another. One of the most common conversions is from OTT (Open Office Text Template) to OFT (Outlook Form Template). OTT files are used to create documents in Open Office, while OFT files are used to create documents in Microsoft Outlook. This conversion is necessary for developers who need to create documents in both Open Office and Outlook.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OTT to OFT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that make the conversion from OTT to OFT easy using Python. The process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into OFT format. This process is automated and makes it easy for developers to convert documents from one format to another.

- Open the source OTT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OTT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OTT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OTT to OFT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
