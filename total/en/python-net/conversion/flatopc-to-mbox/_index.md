<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The FLATOPC format is a proprietary format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails. It is not supported by other email clients and hence it is necessary to convert it to a more widely accepted format like MBOX. MBOX is a standard format used by many email clients and hence it is important to convert FLATOPC to MBOX for compatibility.
