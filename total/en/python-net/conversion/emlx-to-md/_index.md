<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
For a Python developer, who is trying to add a EMLX to MD conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail to store emails. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other email clients. MD is a Markdown format which is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is used to create rich text documents that can be easily shared between different applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EMLX to MD in order to make the emails compatible with other applications.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted
