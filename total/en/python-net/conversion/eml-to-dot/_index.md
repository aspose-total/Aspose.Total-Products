<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert emails to Word documents. This is because emails are often sent in the EML format, which is not compatible with Microsoft Word. Therefore, in order to view and edit the contents of an email, it must be converted to the DOT format, which is compatible with Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EML to DOT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are specifically designed to help with the conversion of emails to Word documents. The process is a two-step process. Firstly, the email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word DOT format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to DOT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
