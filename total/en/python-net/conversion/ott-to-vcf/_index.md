<h2>Why to Convert OTT to VCF?</h2>

OTT (Outlook Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages, contacts, calendar events, and other items. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other email clients. VCF (vCard File) is a widely used file format for storing contact information. It is supported by almost all email clients and is a standard format for exchanging contact information. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OTT to VCF in order to make the contact information accessible to other email clients.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OTT to VCF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which can be used to automate the conversion process from OTT to VCF. It is a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into VCF format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers.

- Open the source OTT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OTT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OTT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OTT to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
