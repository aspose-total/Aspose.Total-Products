Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting VCF to VCF. It includes the APIs "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET". Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" and saved into VCF format.
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" package is a great tool for Python developers who need to convert VCF to VCF. It is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to automate the conversion process. The APIs included in the package are powerful and can be used to quickly and accurately convert Word documents into HTML and then into VCF format. Furthermore, the package is regularly updated with new features and bug fixes, ensuring that the conversion process is always up to date and reliable.

- Open the source VCF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your VCF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the VCF is converted

- For VCF to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
