Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting JPEG to PST format. It includes two APIs, namely Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make the conversion process easy and efficient. The conversion process involves two steps. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into PST format. The APIs provide a wide range of features such as support for various image formats, support for various Microsoft Word formats, and support for various email formats. The APIs also provide a number of useful features such as the ability to convert multiple files in one go, the ability to customize the output format, and the ability to add attachments to the PST file. With the help of these APIs, developers can easily and quickly convert JPEG to PST format with minimal effort.

- Open the source JPEG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your JPEG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the JPEG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For JPEG to PST conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
