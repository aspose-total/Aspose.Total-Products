# Why to Convert RTF to MHTML (Web Archive Format)

The Rich Text Format (RTF) is a document file format that enables the exchange of text between different word processors and text-processing applications. It is a popular format for exchanging documents between different applications and platforms. However, the MHTML (Web Archive Format) is a web page archive format that is used to save web pages in a single file. It is a convenient way to save web pages for offline viewing and is supported by most web browsers. Therefore, it is necessary to convert RTF documents to MHTML (Web Archive Format) in order to view them offline. 

# How Aspose.Total Helps for RTF to MHTML Conversion

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API which can be used to add the RTF to MHTML conversion feature. In case the RTF file is simple, it is just two lines of code. Load the RTF file and call the save method with appropriate file path along with SaveFormat enumeration as MHTML or HTML_FIXED. However, in case if there is need to restore the document model as close to original one then there is need to save some extra information within resultant document called round-trip information. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API provides the capability to save the document in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements. Therefore, Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API can help to automate the conversion process from RTF to MHTML (Web Archive Format).

- Load source RTF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [HtmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/)
- Set the export_roundtrip_information as True
- Specify the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/saveformat/) as MHTML
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat as parameters. So your RTF file is converted to MHTML at the specified path
