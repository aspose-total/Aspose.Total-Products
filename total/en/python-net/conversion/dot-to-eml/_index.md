<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOT file format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is not compatible with other applications and hence it is necessary to convert it to a more widely accepted format like EML. EML is an email message format used by many email clients and services. It is an open standard format and hence can be used by any application.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for dot to eml conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which can be used to automate the conversion process from DOT to EML. The process involves two steps, firstly loading the Word file and rendering it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, loading the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saving it into EML format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers.

- Open the source DOT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOT to EML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
