<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster graphics image format used for storing images. It is widely used for storing images and is supported by many applications. ICS (iCalendar) is a computer file format which allows users to store and exchange calendar and scheduling information. It is used for sharing calendar information between different applications and users. Converting TIFF to ICS is a useful way to share calendar information with others.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TIFF to ICS Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs which makes the conversion of TIFF to ICS easy using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/). Secondly load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and save it into ICS format. This process is automated and helps developers to quickly and easily convert TIFF to ICS.

- Open the source TIFF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your TIFF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the TIFF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For TIFF to ICS conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
