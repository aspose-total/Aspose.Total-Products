<h2>Why to Convert DOTX to EML?</h2>

DOTX is a Microsoft Word template file format which is used to store a set of documents with predefined settings such as page layout, styles, and formatting. It is a great way to create a document with a consistent look and feel. On the other hand, EML is an email message format used by many email clients. It is a great way to store emails in a structured format. Converting DOTX to EML can be useful for archiving emails in a structured format or for creating a template for emails.
