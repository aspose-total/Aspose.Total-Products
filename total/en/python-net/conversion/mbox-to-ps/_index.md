<h2>Why to Convert MBOX to PS?</h2>

The MBOX format is a popular email format used by many email clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and Microsoft Outlook. It is a text-based format that stores emails in a single file. However, the Portable Document Format (PS) is a widely used file format for documents, which is supported by many applications. Converting MBOX to PS allows users to access their emails in a more convenient and secure way.
