Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developers to automate the conversion of PST to RTF files. It includes the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the PST file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API and saved into the desired RTF format. This API package is ideal for Python developers who need to quickly and easily convert PST files to RTF files. It is a reliable and efficient solution that can be used to automate the conversion process and save time and effort.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PST is converted

- For PST to RTF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
