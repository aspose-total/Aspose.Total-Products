<h2>Why to Convert Image to Email?</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a IMAGE to EMAIL conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. Images are a great way to share information, but they are not always the best way to communicate. Email is a much more efficient way to communicate, as it allows for more detailed information to be shared quickly and easily. By converting an image to an email, the developer can ensure that the information is communicated in the most efficient way possible.

- Open the source IMAGE file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your IMAGE file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the IMAGE is converted
