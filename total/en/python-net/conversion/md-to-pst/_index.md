<h2>Why to Convert MD to PST?</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert MD to PST arises when they are trying to add a conversion feature within their application. MD is a Markdown format, which is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. PST, on the other hand, is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, and other items. It is a proprietary file format developed by Microsoft and is used to store data locally on an individual's computer. Therefore, in order to add a conversion feature within an application, it is necessary to convert MD to PST.
