<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

For a Python developer, the ability to convert MHTML and HtmlFixed to Microsoft Word WORDML format is a must-have feature. This is because MHTML and HtmlFixed are two of the most popular formats used for web archiving and document sharing. By converting these formats to WORDML, developers can easily create documents that are compatible with Microsoft Word and other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to WordML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, which makes it easy to export and import MHTML, PDF and other formats using Python. The API also allows developers to save documents in HTML format using absolutely positioned elements. This makes it easier to create documents that are compatible with Microsoft Word and other applications. Additionally, Aspose.Total for Python via .NET also provides support for other formats such as PDF, XPS, and HTML.

- Open the source MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path as parameter. So your MHTML file is converted to WORDML at the specified path
