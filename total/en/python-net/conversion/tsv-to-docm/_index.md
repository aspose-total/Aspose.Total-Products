<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert TSV (Tab Separated Values) files to DOCM (Microsoft Word Open XML Macro-Enabled Document) files. This is because DOCM files are more versatile and can be used to store complex data, such as macros, scripts, and formatting. Additionally, DOCM files are more secure than TSV files, as they are encrypted and can be password protected.

- **Step 1** Open the source TSV file using Workbook class
- Save TSV file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output DOCM file path. So your TSV file is converted to DOCM at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For TSV to DOCM conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/) and [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-cells-python``` and ```pip install aspose.words```
-  Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Cells](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/python-net/getting-started/#installation) and [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow [step by step instructions](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
