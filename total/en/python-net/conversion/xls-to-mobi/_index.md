<h2>Why to Convert XLS to MOBI</h2>

The XLS format is a popular spreadsheet format used by Microsoft Excel. It is widely used for storing and manipulating data. However, the XLS format is not supported by all devices and applications. The MOBI format is a popular ebook format used by Amazon Kindle and other ebook readers. It is supported by a wide range of devices and applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert XLS files to MOBI format in order to make them accessible on different devices and applications.

- **Step 1** Open the source XLS file using Workbook class
- Save XLS file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output MOBI file path. So your XLS file is converted to MOBI at the specified path
