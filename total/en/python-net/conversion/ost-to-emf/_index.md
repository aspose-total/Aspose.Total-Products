<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert OST to EMF format arises when they are trying to add a feature within their application. OST is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. EMF is a vector graphics format used by Windows to store images. Converting OST to EMF format allows the user to view the data in a more accessible format.
