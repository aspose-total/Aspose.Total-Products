<h2>Why to Convert PS to OFT?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used format for documents, but it is not suitable for editing. The Open Document Format (ODF) is an open standard for document exchange and is supported by many applications. It is a better choice for editing documents, as it is more flexible and can be used with a variety of applications.
