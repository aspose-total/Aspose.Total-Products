<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert XLT files to ODT format for various reasons. XLT files are templates used to create new documents, and they are often used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. ODT files, on the other hand, are the native format of the popular open source office suite, OpenOffice. Converting XLT files to ODT format allows developers to create documents that are compatible with OpenOffice, and can be easily edited and shared.

- **Step 1** Open the source XLT file using Workbook class
- Save XLT file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output ODT file path. So your XLT file is converted to ODT at the specified path
