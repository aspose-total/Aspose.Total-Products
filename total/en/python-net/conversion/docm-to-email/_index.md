<h2>Why to Convert DOCM to Email?</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a DOCM to EMAIL conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. DOCM is a Microsoft Word document with macros enabled, which is not supported by most of the email clients. Therefore, it is important to convert DOCM to EMAIL format to ensure that the document is accessible to the recipient.
