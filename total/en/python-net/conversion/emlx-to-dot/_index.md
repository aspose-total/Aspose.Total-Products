<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to DOT?</h2>

EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail to store emails. It is a plain text file that contains the email message, including the headers, body, and attachments. On the other hand, DOT is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a binary file that contains the document's formatting, layout, and other information. Converting EMLX to DOT is useful for users who want to view their emails in a more user-friendly format, such as a Word document.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted
