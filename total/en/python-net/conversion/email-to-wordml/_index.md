<h2>Why to Convert Email to WordML?</h2>

Email to WordML conversion is a useful feature for Python developers who are looking to add a conversion feature within their application. It allows users to convert emails into WordML format, which is a Microsoft Word XML format. This format is useful for creating documents that can be easily edited and shared with others.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to WordML Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion process easy using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word WORDML format. This makes it easy for developers to add the conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source EMAIL file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted

- For EMAIL to WORDML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
