<h2>Why to Convert PNG to EMLX?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert PNG to EMLX format for various reasons. For example, EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail to store emails. It is an XML-based format that stores the email message along with its attachments. This makes it easier to transfer emails between different email clients. Additionally, EMLX files are smaller in size than other email formats, making them easier to store and share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PNG to EMLX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that makes it easy to automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats, including Email, Images and Microsoft Word. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two of the APIs included in the package. These APIs make it easy to convert PNG to EMLX using Python.

The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into EMLX format. This process is simple and efficient, and can be done quickly with the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET.

- Open the source PNG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PNG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PNG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For PNG to EMLX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
