<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert emails to other formats such as PostScript (PS) for various reasons. For example, they may need to convert emails to PS format for archiving purposes, or to make them easier to read and share with others. Whatever the reason, the process of converting emails to PS format can be time consuming and tedious.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EML to PS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that makes it easy to automate the conversion of emails to PS format. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. The process of converting emails to PS format is a two-step process. First, the email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the desired PS format. This makes it easy for Python developers to quickly and easily convert emails to PS format.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to PS conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
