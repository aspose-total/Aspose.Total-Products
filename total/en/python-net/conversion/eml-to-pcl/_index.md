<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert EML to PCL arises when a Python developer wants to add a feature within an application that allows users to convert emails into PCL format. PCL is a page description language developed by Hewlett-Packard that is used to print documents on a wide variety of printers. It is a popular format for printing documents, and is often used in business settings.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted
