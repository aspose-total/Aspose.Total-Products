<h2>Why to Convert OFT to EPUB</h2>

OFT (Outlook Form Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages. It is a binary file format which is not supported by many other applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OFT to EPUB (Electronic Publication) format in order to make the content accessible to a wider audience. EPUB is an open standard format for digital books and publications, which is supported by many devices and applications.
