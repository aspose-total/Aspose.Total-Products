As a Python developer, you may be looking for a way to add a feature to your application that will allow you to convert EMAIL to JPEG. Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API can help you automate this process. This package includes various APIs that can help you deal with different formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word formats. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, both of which are part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package, make this conversion easy using Python. The process is a two-step one. First, you need to load the Email and render it into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Then, you need to load the converted HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it into the respective Word JPEG format. With this package, you can easily and quickly convert EMAIL to JPEG in your Python application.

- Open the source EMAIL file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMAIL to JPEG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
