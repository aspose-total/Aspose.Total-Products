<h2>Why to Convert Email to XPS?</h2>

Email to XPS conversion is a useful process for Python developers who are looking to add a feature to their application. XPS is a fixed-layout document format that is used to preserve document formatting and to facilitate document exchange. It is also used for printing documents, as it is a device-independent format. XPS documents are also easier to view and share than emails, as they are not dependent on the email client used to view them.
