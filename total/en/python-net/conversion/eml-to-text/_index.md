<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert EML to Text via Python?</h2>

Converting EML to text via Python is essential for extracting and simplifying email content into plain text format. This conversion streamlines email data handling, enhances accessibility, and facilitates integration within Python applications, making it valuable for tasks like data analysis, indexing, and document management.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in EML to Text Conversion?</h2>

To add EML to Text conversion in a Python application, the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API offers an automated solution. This comprehensive API package covers various formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. Specifically, the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, part of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, streamline this conversion process in Python. The process entails two steps: first, load the email and render it into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Then, load the converted HTML with Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it in the respective Text format. This approach simplifies EML to Text conversion within Python applications.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

- For EML to Text conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
