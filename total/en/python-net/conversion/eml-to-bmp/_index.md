As a Python developer, if you are looking to add a feature to convert EML to BMP within your application, then [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help you automate the process. This package consists of various APIs that can help you deal with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, you need to load the Email and render it into HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/). Secondly, you need to load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and save it into the respective Word BMP format. This API is easy to use and can help you save time and effort in the conversion process. It is also reliable and secure, so you can be sure that your data is safe and secure. With this API, you can easily convert EML to BMP within your application with ease.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to BMP conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
