<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to PS?</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail, while PS is a PostScript file format used by Adobe Acrobat. Converting EMLX to PS is necessary for users who need to view their emails in a format that is compatible with Adobe Acrobat. Additionally, PS files are more secure than EMLX files, as they are encrypted and can only be opened with a password.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMLX to PS Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the conversion process from EMLX to PS. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the EMLX file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word PS format. This process is simple and efficient, and can be easily automated with the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted
