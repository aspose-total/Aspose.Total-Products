As a Python developer, you can use Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API to add the ODT to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and TIFF Images conversion feature to your application. This API is a full package of various APIs dealing with different formats, and the conversion process is simple and easy to use. All you need to do is load the ODT file and call the save method with the appropriate image path along with the SaveFormat of the relevant format. 
In addition, you can use the ImageSaveOptions class to set extra information such as setting the horizontal and vertical resolution, scale, pixel format, brightness and more. This class allows you to render a specific ODT page into an image with a transparent or colored background, specify a resolution while rendering, configure compression and more. Depending on your requirements, you can use the Word To Image conversion feature for further customization. With Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API, you can easily and quickly add the ODT to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and TIFF Images conversion feature to your application.

- Load source ODT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/)
- Specify page number for conversion using [PageSet](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pageset/)
- Set the properties
- Call the `save` method while passing output file path & specified options as parameters. So your ODT file is converted to Images at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ODT to Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF) conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
