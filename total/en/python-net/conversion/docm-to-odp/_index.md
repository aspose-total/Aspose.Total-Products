For a Python developer, who is trying to add a DOCM to ODP conversion feature within application ? [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. So **How to Convert DOCM to ODP in Python ?**

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API to convert DOCM file to PDF. After that by using PowerPoint Python API [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/), save the created PDF into Presentation as a ODP format.

- **Step 1** Open the source DOCM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Save DOCM file to PDF by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/save/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path.
-  **Step 2** Load PDF file with an instance of [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat.ODP as parameters. So your DOCM file is converted to ODP at the specified path.
