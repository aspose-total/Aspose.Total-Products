<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a popular image format used for storing images. It is widely used in the printing and publishing industry. On the other hand, OST (Offline Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, and other data. It is used to store data in an offline mode. Therefore, for a Python developer, who is trying to add a TIFF to OST conversion feature within application, it is important to convert TIFF to OST format.
