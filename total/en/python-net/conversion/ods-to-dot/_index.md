<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert ODS files to DOT format. ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets, and is used by many applications such as Apache OpenOffice, LibreOffice, and Google Docs. DOT (Document Template) is a Microsoft Word template format used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. Converting ODS to DOT allows users to create documents with a consistent look and feel, while still being able to use the features of the ODS format.

- **Step 1** Open the source ODS file using Workbook class
- Save ODS file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output DOT file path. So your ODS file is converted to DOT at the specified path
