<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a Python developer, you may need to add a feature to your application that allows users to convert POWERPOINT files to XLSB format. This is because XLSB files are more compact and efficient than other formats, and they can be used to store large amounts of data in a smaller file size. Additionally, XLSB files are easier to share and can be opened in a variety of programs, making them a great choice for data storage and sharing.
