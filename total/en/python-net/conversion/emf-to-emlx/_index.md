<h2>Why to Convert EMF to EMLX?</h2>

EMF (Enhanced Metafile) is a vector image format used to store images and graphics. It is a Windows-specific format and is not supported by other operating systems. On the other hand, EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail. It is an XML-based format and is used to store emails in the Apple Mail application. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EMF to EMLX in order to view the images and graphics in Apple Mail.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for EMF to EMLX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion of EMF to EMLX easy using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into EMLX format. This process can be automated using the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API.

- Open the source EMF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMF to EMLX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
