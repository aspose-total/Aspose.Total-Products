<h2>Why to Convert WordML to MSG?</h2>

WordML is a markup language used to represent a Microsoft Word document. It is an XML-based format that is used to store and transport documents. MSG is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, and other Outlook items. It is a binary file format that is used to store email messages, contacts, appointments, and other Outlook items. Converting WordML to MSG allows users to access their documents in the MSG format, which is more widely used and supported by various applications.
