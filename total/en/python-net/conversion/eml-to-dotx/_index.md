<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert emails to Microsoft Word documents for various reasons. For example, emails may need to be converted to Word documents for archiving, for further editing, or for sharing with other users. Converting emails to Word documents can be a time-consuming and tedious process, but with the right tools, it can be automated.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EML to DOTX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help automate the process of converting emails to Word documents. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. This package makes it easy to convert emails to Word documents using Python.

The process of converting emails to Word documents is a two-step process. First, the email must be loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML can be loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word DOTX format. This process can be automated using Python, making it easier and faster to convert emails to Word documents.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

- For EML to DOTX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
