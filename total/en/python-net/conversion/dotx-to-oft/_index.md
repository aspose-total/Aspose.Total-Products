<h2>Why to Convert DOTX to OFT?</h2>

The DOTX file format is a Microsoft Word template file that is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is a great way to ensure that all documents created from the template have the same formatting and layout. However, the DOTX format is not supported by all applications, so it is often necessary to convert it to a more widely supported format such as OFT.

- Open the source DOTX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOTX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOTX is converted
