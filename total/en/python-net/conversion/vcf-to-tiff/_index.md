<h2>Why to Convert VCF to TIFF</h2>
VCF (Virtual Contact File) is a file format used to store contact information such as name, address, phone number, email address, etc. It is widely used by many applications and devices to store contact information. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a popular image format used for storing images. It is widely used in the printing and publishing industry. Converting VCF to TIFF can be useful for many applications such as creating contact cards, printing contact information, etc.

- Open the source VCF file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your VCF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the VCF is converted

- For VCF to TIFF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
