<h2>Why to Convert EML to EML?</h2>

EML is a popular file format used for storing emails. It is widely used by many email clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, etc. It is also used by many email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, etc. EML files are also used to store emails in a text format. This makes them easy to share and store. However, there are times when a user may need to convert an EML file to another format. This could be for a variety of reasons, such as to make the file compatible with a different email client or to make it easier to share with others.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for EML to EML Conversion?</h2>

It provides a comprehensive set of APIs that can be used to automate the conversion process. The [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs that are part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package makes this conversion easy using Python. It's a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/). Secondly load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and save it into EML format. This makes it easy for a Python developer to add a EML to EML conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source EML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted
