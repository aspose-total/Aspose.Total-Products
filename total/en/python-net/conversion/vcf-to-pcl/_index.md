VCF (Virtual Contact File) is a file format used to store contact information such as name, address, phone number, email address, etc. It is widely used by many email clients and other applications. PCL (Printer Command Language) is a page description language used by printers to control the printing process. It is a powerful language that can be used to create complex documents with graphics, text, and images.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your VCF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the VCF is converted
