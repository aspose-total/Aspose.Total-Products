<h2>Why to Convert PS to MBOX?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is often used for archiving and printing. However, the PDF format is not suitable for emailing, as it is not easily readable by email clients. The MBOX format, on the other hand, is a popular email file format that is used by many email clients, such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and Microsoft Outlook. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF documents to MBOX format in order to make them readable by email clients.
