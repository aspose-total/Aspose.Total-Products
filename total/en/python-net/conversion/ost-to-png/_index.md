<h2>Why to Convert OST to PNG?</h2>

The OST (Offline Storage Table) file format is used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, calendar items, tasks, and other data. It is an offline version of the PST (Personal Storage Table) file format, which is used to store data on the server. OST files are not compatible with other applications, so they must be converted to a more widely accepted format such as PNG (Portable Network Graphics) in order to be used in other applications.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
