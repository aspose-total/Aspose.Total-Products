<h2>Why to Convert OST to Word?</h2>

OST files are used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, calendar items, and other data. These files are not compatible with other applications, so it is necessary to convert them to a more widely used format such as Word. Word documents are easier to share and can be opened on any device with a compatible word processor.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OST to Word Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from OST to Word. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the OST file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the desired Word format. This process is simple and efficient, allowing developers to quickly and easily convert OST files to Word documents.

- Open the source OST file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OST is converted

- For OST to WORD conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
