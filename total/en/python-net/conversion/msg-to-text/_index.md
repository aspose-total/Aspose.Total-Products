<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert MSG to Text via Python?</h2>

Converting MSG to text via Python is important for simplifying message content extraction and making it accessible and readable in a plain text format. This process enables effective data handling, searching, and integration within Python applications, enhancing data processing and accessibility for various purposes.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in MSG to Text Conversion?</h2>

For Python developers looking to implement MSG to TEXT conversion in their applications, the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API provides an automated solution. This comprehensive API package covers various formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. Specifically, the Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and Aspose.Words for Python via .NET APIs, part of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, streamline this conversion process using Python. The process involves two steps: first, load the email and render it as HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and then load the converted HTML with Aspose.Words for Python via .NET to save it in the respective TEXT format. This approach simplifies MSG to TEXT conversion within Python applications.

- Open the source MSG file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MSG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MSG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="MSG to Text Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MSG to TEXT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
