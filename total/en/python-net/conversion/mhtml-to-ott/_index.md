<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Microsoft Word OTT format is a popular document format used by many organizations. It is a text-based format that is easy to read and edit. However, it is not suitable for web-based applications. To make the documents more accessible and easier to use in web-based applications, it is necessary to convert the documents to MHTML and HtmlFixed formats. 

MHTML and HtmlFixed formats are HTML-based formats that are optimized for web-based applications. They are more accessible and easier to use than the Microsoft Word OTT format. They also allow for more flexibility in terms of styling and formatting.
