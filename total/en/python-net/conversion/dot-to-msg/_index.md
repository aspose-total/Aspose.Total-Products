<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert DOT to MSG files for various reasons. DOT files are the native file format of Microsoft Word and are used to store documents. MSG files are used to store emails and other messages. Converting DOT to MSG allows developers to store emails and other messages in a format that is compatible with Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOT to MSG Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make it easy to convert DOT to MSG using Python. The process involves two steps: first, loading the Word file and rendering it into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, and second, loading the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saving it into MSG format. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert DOT to MSG files.

- Open the source DOT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOT to MSG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
