<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert ODT (OpenDocument Text) files to MHTML (Web archive format) or HtmlFixed format to save the document in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements within application. This conversion process can be automated with the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API. 

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for odt to mhtml conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. We use Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API that is part of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET Package to add the ODT to MHTML conversion feature. In case the ODT file is simple then its just two lines of code. Load the ODT file and call the save method with appropriate file path along with SaveFormat enumeration as MHTML or HTML_FIXED. But in case if there is need to restore the document model as close to original one then there is need to save some extra information within resultant document called round-trip information. This can be achieved by using the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API. 

The API provides a wide range of features to manipulate documents in various formats. It supports a wide range of document formats such as DOC, DOCX, ODT, HTML, MHTML, PDF, XPS, EPUB, and many more. It also provides features to convert documents from one format to another. It supports features such as document conversion, document manipulation, document comparison, document signing, document printing, and many more.

- Load source ODT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [HtmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/)
- Set the export_roundtrip_information as True
- Specify the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/saveformat/) as MHTML
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat as parameters. So your ODT file is converted to MHTML at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ODT to MHTML or HtmlFixed format conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
