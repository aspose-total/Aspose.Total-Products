<h2>Why to Convert XLS to POTX</h2>

The XLS format is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format, which is widely used for storing tabular data. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other applications. On the other hand, POTX is a Microsoft PowerPoint template format, which is used for creating presentations. It is an open format and is supported by many applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert XLS to POTX in order to make the data available in a format that can be used by other applications.
