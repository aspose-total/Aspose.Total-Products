<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a Python developer, if you are looking to add a feature to your application that can convert POTX to XLTX files, then Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API can be a great help. It is a full package of various APIs dealing with different file formats, including POTX and XLTX files.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for POTX to XLTX Conversion</h2>

The conversion process is mainly in two steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET API to convert the POTX file to HTML. After that, you can use Excel Python API Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET to save the created HTML into the desired Microsoft Excel format. This way, you can easily convert POTX to XLTX files with the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API.

- Save POTX file to HTML by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of Workbook class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output XLTX file path. So your POTX file is converted to XLTX at the specified path
