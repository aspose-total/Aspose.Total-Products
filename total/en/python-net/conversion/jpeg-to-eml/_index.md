Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that can help Python developers automate the process of converting JPEG to EML. It is a comprehensive package of various APIs that can be used to deal with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file needs to be loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the converted HTML needs to be loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into the EML format.
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" API package is a great tool for Python developers who are looking to add a JPEG to EML conversion feature within their application. It is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to convert JPEG to EML. The API package also provides a wide range of features and functions that can be used to customize the conversion process. Furthermore, the API package is regularly updated with new features and bug fixes, ensuring that the conversion process is always up to date and efficient.

- Open the source JPEG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your JPEG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the JPEG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For JPEG to EML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
