<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert MHTML and HtmlFixed to Microsoft Word ODT format arises when they need to add a feature within their application. This feature will help to save the document in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements. This conversion is necessary to ensure that the document is compatible with the application and can be used without any issues.
