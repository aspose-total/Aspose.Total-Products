<h2>Why to Convert WordML to EMLX?</h2>

WordML is a markup language used to represent Microsoft Word documents. It is an XML-based format that is used to store and transport documents. On the other hand, EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail to store emails. It is an XML-based format that stores the email message, its attachments, and other related information. Converting WordML to EMLX can be useful for a Python developer who wants to add a feature to their application that allows users to convert WordML documents to EMLX format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for WordML to EMLX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that make it easy to convert WordML to EMLX using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into EMLX format. This makes it easy for Python developers to add a feature to their application that allows users to convert WordML documents to EMLX format.

- Open the source WORDML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your WORDML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the WORDML is converted
