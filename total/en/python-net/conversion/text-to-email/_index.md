<h2>Why to Convert TXT to Email File Formats via Python?</h2>

Converting TXT to email file formats via Python is important for transforming plain text into a structured, shareable, and easily distributable format for communication and collaboration, facilitating email content generation and integration within Python applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps in TXT to Email Conversion?</h2>

For Python developers seeking to implement a Text to Email conversion feature in their applications, the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API offers automation support. This comprehensive API package encompasses various formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. Specifically, the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package, simplify the conversion process in Python. This entails a two-step procedure: first, load the Text file, convert it to HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, and subsequently load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET to save it in Email format, streamlining the entire conversion process.

- Open the source Text file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your Text file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the Text is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Text to Email Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For Text to Email conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
