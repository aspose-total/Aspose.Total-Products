<h2>Why to Convert OFT to DOTM?</h2>

The OFT format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages, contacts, calendar items, and other Outlook items. It is a binary file format, which means it is not easily readable by other programs. On the other hand, the DOTM format is a Microsoft Word template file format, which is an XML-based file format. This makes it easier to read and edit, and it is also more compatible with other programs. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert OFT files to DOTM files in order to make them more accessible and easier to work with.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted
