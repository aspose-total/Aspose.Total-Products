<h2>Why to Convert OTT to MBOX?</h2>

OTT (Outlook Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages, contacts, calendar items, tasks, notes, and other Outlook items. It is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook and is not supported by other email clients. On the other hand, MBOX is a widely used file format for storing email messages. It is supported by many email clients and is used for archiving emails. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OTT to MBOX in order to make the data accessible to other email clients.
