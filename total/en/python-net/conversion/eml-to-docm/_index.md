As a Python developer, if you are looking to add a feature to convert EML to DOCM within your application, then [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can be of great help. It is a comprehensive package of various APIs that can be used to deal with different file formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process can be automated using [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs that are part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package. The process involves two steps, firstly the Email needs to be loaded and rendered into HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/). Secondly, the converted HTML can be loaded using [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and saved into the respective Word DOCM format. This process is simple and efficient and can be used to quickly convert EML to DOCM files.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to DOCM conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
