<h2>Why to Convert JPEG to Email?</h2>

For a Python developer, the ability to convert JPEG to Email format can be a great asset. Email is a widely used format for communication and sharing documents, and JPEG is a popular image format. Converting JPEG to Email format allows users to share images in a more efficient and secure way.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JPEG to Email Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. This package makes it easy to convert JPEG to Email format using Python. The process involves two steps: first, loading the Word file and rendering it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, and second, loading the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saving it into EMAIL format. This process is simple and efficient, and can be used to quickly and securely share images in Email format.

- Open the source JPEG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your JPEG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the JPEG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For JPEG to EMAIL conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
