<h2>Why to Convert OFT to TIFF</h2>

Python developers often need to convert Outlook OFT files to TIFF format for various reasons. TIFF is a popular image format used for storing high-quality images and is widely used in the printing industry. It is also used for storing large documents such as scanned documents and photographs. Converting OFT files to TIFF format allows developers to store and share documents in a more efficient manner.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OFT to TIFF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from OFT to TIFF. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two of the APIs included in the package. 

The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word TIFF format. This process is simple and efficient, and can be easily automated using Python. 

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a great tool for Python developers who need to convert OFT files to TIFF format. It is a comprehensive package of APIs that makes the conversion process easy and efficient. It is also simple to automate the process using Python.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OFT to TIFF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
