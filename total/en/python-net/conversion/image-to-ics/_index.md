<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting an image to ICS format can be beneficial for a Python developer who is trying to add a feature within an application. ICS is a file format used to store calendar information, such as events, meetings, and other appointments. It is supported by many calendar applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar. By converting an image to ICS format, the developer can ensure that the calendar information is accessible to users of these applications.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your IMAGE file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the IMAGE is converted
