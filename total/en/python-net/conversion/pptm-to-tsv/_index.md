<h2>Why to Convert PPTM to TSV</h2>

Python developers often need to convert PPTM files to TSV format for various reasons. PPTM is a Microsoft PowerPoint macro-enabled presentation file format which is used to store presentations with macros. It is not supported by many applications and devices, so it is necessary to convert it to a more compatible format like TSV. TSV stands for Tab Separated Values and is a text file format which is used to store data in a tabular form. It is a widely used format and is supported by many applications and devices.
