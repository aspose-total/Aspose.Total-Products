<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert DOC to Excel Formats via Python?</h2>

Converting DOC (Word) to Excel formats via Python is important for extracting and structuring textual data into spreadsheet form. This process simplifies data manipulation, analysis, and sharing, enabling more versatile use of text-based content in Excel for various applications and tasks.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in DOC to Excel Format Conversion?</h2>

[Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API provides a comprehensive solution for Python developers looking to automate the DOC to Excel conversion process within their applications. The package offers a range of APIs that handle various formats.<br><br>

The process involves two main steps. First, developers can use the [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API to convert the DOC file to HTML. Next, they can use the [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/) API to save the generated HTML in the desired Microsoft Excel format. This two-step process enables seamless conversion of documents between the two formats, allowing developers to automate the process and save time.

Developers can use the pip commands `pip install aspose.words` and `pip install aspose-cells-python` to install the required Aspose APIs for DOC to Excel conversion in Python. It's also important to ensure that the system requirements for both APIs are met, and for Linux systems, additional requirements for gcc and libpython may need to be checked. Developers can find step-by-step installation instructions in the Aspose documentation.
