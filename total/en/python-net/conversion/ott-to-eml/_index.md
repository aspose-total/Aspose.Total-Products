<h2>Why to Convert OTT to EML?</h2>

OTT (Open Text Template) is a file format used to create documents with a combination of text, images, and other objects. It is widely used for creating documents such as letters, invoices, and reports. EML (Email Message Format) is a file format used to store email messages. It is widely used by email clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, and Mozilla Thunderbird. Converting OTT to EML allows users to store their documents in an email format, which can be easily shared and accessed.
