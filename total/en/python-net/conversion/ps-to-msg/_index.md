<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert a PS file to MSG format arises when a Python developer is trying to add a feature within an application that requires the conversion of PS files to MSG format. This conversion is necessary as MSG files are more compatible with various email clients and can be easily shared over the internet.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
