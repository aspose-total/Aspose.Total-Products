Why to Convert

There can be different reasons to convert a DOTM file to PST. For example, a user may want to open a DOTM file in Microsoft Outlook for Windows, which is not possible without conversion. Aspose.Total for Python via .NET can help developers automate the conversion of DOTM files to PST. 

How Aspose.Total helps for dotm to pst conversion

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word formats. The [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs, which are part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package, make this conversion easy using Python. The process is completed in two steps: first, load the Word file and render it into HTML via [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/). Secondly, load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and save it into PST format.
