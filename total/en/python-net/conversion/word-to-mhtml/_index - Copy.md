For a Python developer, who is trying to add a Word to MHTML (Web archive format) conversion feature or HtmlFixed mean want to saves the document in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements within application? ASPOSE.TOTAL API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. 

We use ASPOSE.WORDS API that is part of ASPOSE.TOTAL Package to add the Word to MHTML conversion feature. In case the Word file is simple then its just two lines of code. Load the Word file and call the save method with appropriate file path along with SaveFormat enumeration as MHTML or HTML_FIXED. But in case if there is need to restore a document model as close to the original as possible then there is need to save some extra information within resultant document called round-trip information.

- Load source Word file using ASPOSE.WORDS.DOCUMENT class
- Create the instance of [HtmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/).
- Set the export_roundtrip_information as True
- Specify the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/saveformat/) as MHTML
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat as parameters. So your Word file is converted to MHTML at the specified path.
