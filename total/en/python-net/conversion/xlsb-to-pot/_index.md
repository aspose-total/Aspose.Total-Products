<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
Python developers often need to convert XLSB files to POT format for various reasons. XLSB files are binary files that are used to store data in a compressed format. They are usually used for large data sets and are not compatible with many applications. On the other hand, POT files are Microsoft PowerPoint files that are used to store presentations. They are widely used for presentations and can be opened and edited in many applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert XLSB files to POT format.
