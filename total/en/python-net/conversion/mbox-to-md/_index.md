Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developers to automate the conversion of MBOX to MD format within their applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and secondly, the HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word MD format. This API package is a great solution for Python developers who are looking to add a MBOX to MD conversion feature within their applications.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MBOX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MBOX is converted

- For MBOX to MD conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
