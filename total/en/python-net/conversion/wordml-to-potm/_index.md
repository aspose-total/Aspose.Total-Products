<h2>Why to Convert WordML to POTM?</h2>

WordML is a markup language used to represent the content of a Microsoft Word document. It is an XML-based format that is used to store and transport documents. It is a great way to store documents in a structured format, but it is not suitable for presentation purposes. POTM, on the other hand, is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a great way to create presentations with animations, transitions, and other effects. Therefore, it is necessary to convert WordML to POTM in order to create a presentation from a Word document.
