<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOT to VCF conversion is a useful feature for Python developers who are looking to add the ability to convert DOT files into VCF format within their applications. DOT files are used to store contact information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. VCF files are used to store contact information in a format that is compatible with many different applications, such as email clients, contact management software, and web browsers. By converting DOT files to VCF format, developers can ensure that their applications are able to access and use contact information stored in DOT files.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOT to VCF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs that make the conversion of DOT to VCF files easy using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/). Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and saved into VCF format. This process is automated and makes it easy for developers to add the DOT to VCF conversion feature to their applications.

- Open the source DOT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOT to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
