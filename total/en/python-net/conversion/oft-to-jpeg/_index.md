Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developers to automate the conversion of OFT to JPEG format within their applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make the conversion process easy and efficient. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and then the HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the desired Word JPEG format. This API package is ideal for Python developers who are looking to add a OFT to JPEG conversion feature to their applications. It is a reliable and efficient solution that can help developers save time and effort in the conversion process.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OFT to JPEG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
