<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The FLATOPC format is a proprietary format used by Microsoft Outlook to store contact information. It is not supported by other email clients and applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert FLATOPC to VCF format in order to make the contact information accessible to other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for flatopc to vcf conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers to automate the conversion process from FLATOPC to VCF. It includes APIs for dealing with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two of the APIs that are part of the Aspose.Total package. 

The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into VCF format. This process is easy to implement using Python and can be automated with the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET.

- Open the source FLATOPC file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your FLATOPC file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the FLATOPC is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For FLATOPC to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
