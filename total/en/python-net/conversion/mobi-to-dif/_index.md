<h2>Why to Convert MOBI to DIF</h2>

The MOBI file format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not compatible with many other applications. For example, if you want to use the content of a MOBI file in a spreadsheet, you will need to convert it to a DIF file. DIF stands for Data Interchange Format and is a file format used to transfer data between different applications. It is a popular format for exchanging data between spreadsheets, databases, and other applications.
