<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to OFT?</h2>

EPUB is an open standard format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is based on HTML and XML and is supported by most e-book readers. OFT is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook for storing email messages, contacts, tasks, and calendar items. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other email clients. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to OFT in order to make the content compatible with Microsoft Outlook.
