<h2>Why to Convert RTF to XLT</h2>

Rich Text Format (RTF) is a document file format used by Microsoft Word and other word processing applications. It is a text-based format that supports basic text formatting such as bold, italic, underline, font size, and color. However, it does not support advanced features such as tables, charts, and images. On the other hand, Microsoft Excel (XLT) is a spreadsheet application that supports advanced features such as tables, charts, and images. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert RTF documents to XLT in order to take advantage of the advanced features of Excel.
