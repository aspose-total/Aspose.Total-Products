For a Python developer, who is trying to add a DOCX to MHTML (Web archive format) conversion feature or HtmlFixed mean want to save the document in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. 

We use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API that is part of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) Package to add the DOCX to MHTML conversion feature. In case the DOCX file is simple then its just two lines of code. Load the DOCX file and call the save method with appropriate file path along with SaveFormat enumeration as MHTML or HTML_FIXED. But in case if there is need to restore the document model as close to original one then there is need to save some extra information within resultant document called round-trip information.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="How to Convert DOCX to MHTML in Python" %}}
- Load source DOCX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [HtmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/)
- Set the export_roundtrip_information as True
- Specify the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/saveformat/) as MHTML
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat as parameters. So your DOCX file is converted to MHTML at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOCX to MHTML or HtmlFixed format conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
