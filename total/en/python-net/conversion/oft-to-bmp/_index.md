<h2>Why to Convert OFT to BMP</h2>

Python developers often need to convert Outlook OFT files to BMP format for various reasons. BMP is a popular image format that is widely used for storing digital images. It is a lossless format, which means that the image quality is not compromised when the file is compressed. BMP files are also compatible with most operating systems, making them an ideal choice for sharing images.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OFT to BMP conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
