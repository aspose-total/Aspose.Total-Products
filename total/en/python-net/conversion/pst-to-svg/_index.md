<h2>Why to Convert PST to SVG?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents because it is platform independent and can be viewed on any device. However, the PDF format does not support the use of vector graphics, which is why it is often necessary to convert PST to SVG. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and is a vector-based image format that is supported by most modern web browsers. It is ideal for displaying vector graphics on the web, as it is resolution independent and can be scaled to any size without losing quality.
