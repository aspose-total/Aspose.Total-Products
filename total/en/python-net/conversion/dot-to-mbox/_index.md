<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOT file format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails. It is not a widely used format and is not supported by many email clients. Therefore, it is important to convert DOT files to MBOX format, which is a widely used format and is supported by many email clients.
