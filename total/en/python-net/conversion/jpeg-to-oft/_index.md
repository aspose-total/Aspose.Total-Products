Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting a JPEG to OFT format. It includes the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into OFT format.
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" package is a great tool for Python developers who need to quickly and easily convert JPEG to OFT format. It is a reliable and efficient solution that can help developers save time and effort when dealing with different file formats. Furthermore, the APIs included in the package are easy to use and understand, making the conversion process even simpler. With the help of "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET", developers can quickly and easily convert JPEG to OFT format and save time and effort in the process.

- Open the source JPEG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your JPEG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the JPEG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For JPEG to OFT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
