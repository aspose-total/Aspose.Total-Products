<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to BMP?</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail, while BMP is a bitmap image format. Converting EMLX to BMP can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as when a user wants to save an email as an image or when an application needs to display an email as an image. 

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMLX to BMP Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which can be used to automate the conversion process from EMLX to BMP. This conversion process is a two step process. Firstly, the EMLX file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word BMP format. This process is easy to use and can be automated using Python.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMLX to BMP conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
