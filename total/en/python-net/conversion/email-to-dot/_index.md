<h2>Why to Convert Email to DOT?</h2>

Email to DOT conversion is a useful process for Python developers who are looking to add a feature to their application. Email messages are often sent in the form of an EML file, which is a text-based file format. However, this format is not suitable for editing or formatting. Converting an EML file to a DOT file allows the user to open the file in Microsoft Word and edit it as needed.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to DOT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two of the APIs included in the package. These APIs can be used to convert an EML file to a DOT file in two steps. 

The first step is to load the Email file and render it into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. The second step is to load the converted HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it into the respective Word DOT format. This process is simple and efficient, and it allows the user to quickly and easily convert an EML file to a DOT file.

- Open the source EMAIL file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMAIL to DOT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
