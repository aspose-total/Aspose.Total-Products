<h2>Why to Convert VCF to DOC?</h2>

VCF (Virtual Contact File) is a file format used to store contact information such as name, address, phone number, email address, etc. It is widely used by many applications and devices to store and exchange contact information. However, VCF files are not compatible with many applications and devices, and thus it is necessary to convert them into a more compatible format such as DOC.

- Open the source VCF file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your VCF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the VCF is converted
