<h2>Why to Convert OST to RTF</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OST to RTF conversion feature within application, the need to convert OST to RTF arises. OST (Offline Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, calendar items, tasks, notes, etc. on the local computer. It is a proprietary file format of Microsoft Outlook and is not supported by other applications. On the other hand, RTF (Rich Text Format) is a document file format developed by Microsoft Corporation. It is a cross-platform document format that supports almost all word processing applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OST to RTF in order to make the data accessible to other applications.
