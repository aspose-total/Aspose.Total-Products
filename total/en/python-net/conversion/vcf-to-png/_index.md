Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting VCF to PNG. It includes "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the HTML is loaded using "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API and saved into the respective Word PNG format. This API package is a great tool for Python developers who are looking to add a VCF to PNG conversion feature to their applications.

- Open the source VCF file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your VCF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the VCF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For VCF to PNG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
