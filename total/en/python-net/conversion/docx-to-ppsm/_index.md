<h2>Why to Convert DOCX to PPSM?</h2>

The DOCX file format is a popular document format used by Microsoft Word. It is a great way to store and share documents, but it is not compatible with all applications. The PPSM format is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a great way to store and share presentations, but it is not compatible with all applications. Converting a DOCX file to a PPSM file allows the user to share the document with a wider audience, as the PPSM format is more widely supported.
