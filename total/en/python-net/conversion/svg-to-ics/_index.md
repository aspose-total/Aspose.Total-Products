Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of adding a SVG to ICS conversion feature within their application. It includes APIs for dealing with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into ICS format. This package makes it easy for developers to add the SVG to ICS conversion feature to their application using Python. It is a reliable and efficient solution that can help developers save time and effort in the development process.

- Open the source SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your SVG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the SVG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For SVG to ICS conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
