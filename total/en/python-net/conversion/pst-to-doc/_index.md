<h2>Why to Convert PST to DOC</h2>

The PST (Personal Storage Table) format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. It is a great way to store and organize data, but it is not very useful for sharing with other applications. The DOC (Document) format, on the other hand, is a widely used file format for documents created by Microsoft Word. It is a great way to share documents with other applications and users. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PST files to DOC format in order to share the data with other applications or users.
