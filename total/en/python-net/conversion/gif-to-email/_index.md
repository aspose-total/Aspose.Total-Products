<h2>Why to Convert?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert emails to other formats for various reasons. For example, they may need to convert an email to a Word document for archiving or to a PDF for printing. Additionally, they may need to convert an email to an image format for sharing or to an HTML format for web publishing. Whatever the reason, the ability to convert emails to other formats is an important part of any Python developer's toolkit.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to Email Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that makes it easy for Python developers to automate the conversion of emails to other formats. It includes the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, which make it easy to convert emails to Word documents, PDFs, images, and HTML. The process is simple and straightforward: first, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, and then the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into the desired email format. This makes it easy for Python developers to quickly and easily convert emails to other formats with minimal effort.

- Open the source EMAIL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted
