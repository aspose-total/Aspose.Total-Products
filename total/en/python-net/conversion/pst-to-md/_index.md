<h2>Why to Convert PST to MD?</h2>

The PST to MD conversion is a process of converting emails stored in the PST format to the MD format. This conversion is necessary for a Python developer who is trying to add a PST to MD conversion feature within an application. The MD format is a popular format for storing emails and is widely used by many email clients. It is also a more secure format than the PST format, which makes it a preferred choice for many users.
