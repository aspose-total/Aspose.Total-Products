<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to DOCX?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert emails stored in EMLX format to DOCX format. This is because DOCX is a widely used format for documents and is supported by many applications. It is also easier to share and store documents in DOCX format. Therefore, it is important for developers to be able to convert EMLX to DOCX.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMLX to DOCX Conversion?</h2>

It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs which makes it easy to convert EMLX to DOCX using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted
