For a Python developer, who is trying to add a PPSX to WORD conversion feature within application? [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. 

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) API to convert PPSX file to PDF. After that by using Microsoft Word Python API [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/), save the created PDF into Microsoft Word as a WORD format.
