<h2>Why to Convert DOCM to OST</h2>

The DOCM file format is a Microsoft Word document that contains macros, which are pieces of code that automate tasks. However, the OST format is an offline storage file used by Microsoft Outlook, which is a popular email client. Therefore, it is necessary to convert DOCM files to OST format in order to use them in Outlook.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOCM to OST Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process of DOCM to OST. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are two APIs that make the conversion easy using Python. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into OST format. This makes the conversion process simple and efficient.

- Open the source DOCM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOCM file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOCM is converted
