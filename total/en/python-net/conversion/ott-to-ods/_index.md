<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert OTT files to ODS format for various reasons. OTT files are mainly used for creating documents with rich text formatting, while ODS files are used for creating spreadsheets with data. Converting OTT to ODS allows developers to create spreadsheets with rich text formatting.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OTT to ODS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. It helps developers to automate the conversion process from OTT to ODS. The process is mainly in two steps. Firstly, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API is used to convert OTT file to HTML.

This API also provides features like creating, manipulating, and converting spreadsheets. It also supports a wide range of features like creating charts, tables, and pivot tables. It also supports features like formatting cells, rows, and columns.
