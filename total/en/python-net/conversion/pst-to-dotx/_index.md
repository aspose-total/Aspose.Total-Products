<h2>Why to Convert PST to DOTX?</h2>

The PST (Personal Storage Table) format is used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. It is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. On the other hand, DOTX is a template file format used by Microsoft Word. It is used to store documents with predefined formatting, layout, and styles. Converting PST to DOTX allows users to access the data stored in PST files in a Word document.
