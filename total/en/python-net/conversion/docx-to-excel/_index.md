For a Python developer, who is trying to add a DOCX to EXCEL conversion feature within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats.

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API to convert DOCX file to HTML. After that by using Excel Python API [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/), save the created HTML into desired Microsoft Excel format.

- **Step 1** Open the source DOCX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Save DOCX file to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/save/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of Workbook class with file and LoadOptions as parameters
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output EXCEL file path. So your DOCX file is converted to EXCEL at the specified path
