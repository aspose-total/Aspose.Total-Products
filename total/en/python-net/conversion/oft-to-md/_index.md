- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted
