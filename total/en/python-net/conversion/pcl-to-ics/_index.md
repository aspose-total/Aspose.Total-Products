Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting PCL to ICS. It includes "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs which make the conversion process easy. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET". Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" and saved into ICS format. 
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" package is a great tool for Python developers who are looking to add a PCL to ICS conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PCL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PCL is converted

- For PCL to ICS conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
