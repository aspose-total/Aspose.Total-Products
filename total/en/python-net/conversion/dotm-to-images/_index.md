Why to Convert

There can be various reasons to convert a DOTM file to image. For example, to share the document with someone who does not have Microsoft Word installed on their system or to prevent others from making changes to the document. Images can also be easier to view on a mobile device than a Word document.

How Aspose.Total helps for dotm to images conversion

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. We use Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API that is part of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET Package to add the DOTM to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and TIFF Images conversion feature.

For just conversion, it's just two lines of code. Load the DOTM file and call the save method with the appropriate image path along with SaveFormat of the relevant format. But in case if there is a need to set extra information like setting horizontal and vertical resolution, scale, pixel format, brightness, and more, then there is the ImageSaveOptions class to be used for all these.

Using ImageSaveOptions, one can easily render a specific DOTM page into an image with a transparent or colored background, specify a resolution while rendering, configure compression, and more. Depending on the requirement, one can use as of his requirement.

- Load source DOTM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/)
- Specify page number for conversion using [PageSet](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pageset/)
- Set the properties
- Call the `save` method while passing output file path & specified options as parameters. So your DOTM file is converted to Images at the specified path

- For DOTM to Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF) conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
