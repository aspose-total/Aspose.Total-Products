For a Python developer, who is trying to add a DOTM to PNG, BMP, TIFF, JPEG and GIF Images conversion feature within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to import and export images and Word files as well as to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. 

We use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API that is part of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) Package to add the DOTM to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and TIFF Images conversion feature. For just conversion it's just two lines of code. Load the DOTM file and call the save method with appropriate image path along with SaveFormat of relevant format. But in case if there is need to set extra information like setting horizental and vertical resolution, scale, pixel format, brightness and more, then there is [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) class to be used for all these. Using [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) one can easily renders a specific DOTM page into an image with transparent or colored background, specify a resolution while rendering, configure compression and more. Depending on the requirement, one can use as of his requirement, Here is another way for [Word To Image](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/conversion/word-to-image/) conversion.

- Load source DOTM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/)
- Specify page number for conversion using [PageSet](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pageset/)
- Set the properties
- Call the `save` method while passing output file path & specified options as parameters. So your DOTM file is converted to Images at the specified path

- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
