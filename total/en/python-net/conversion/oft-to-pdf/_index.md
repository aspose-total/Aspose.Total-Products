Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting OFT to PDF. It includes APIs for dealing with Email, Images, and Microsoft Word formats. The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API. Then, the HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API and saved into the respective Word PDF format. This package makes it easy to convert OFT to PDF using Python. It is a reliable and efficient solution for developers who need to add this feature to their applications.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted

- For OFT to PDF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
