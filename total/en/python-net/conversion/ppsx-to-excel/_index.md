<h2>Why to Convert PPSX to Excel</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular file format for documents. It is widely used for sharing documents online and for archiving documents for long-term storage. However, PDFs are not always the best format for data analysis and manipulation. For this purpose, Microsoft Excel is a better choice. Converting PPSX to Excel allows users to take advantage of the powerful features of Excel, such as sorting, filtering, and data analysis.
