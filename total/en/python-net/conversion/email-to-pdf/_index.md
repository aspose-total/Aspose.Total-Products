<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert Emails to PDF format via Python?</h2>

Converting emails to PDF format via Python is valuable for archiving, sharing, and ensuring consistent email content across platforms. This conversion simplifies email data management, enhances accessibility, and facilitates secure document storage, making it useful for record-keeping, legal compliance, and document management within Python applications.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in Email to PDF Conversion?</h2>

For Python developers aiming to incorporate Email to PDF conversion functionality into their applications, the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API offers a comprehensive solution. This API package covers a variety of formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word formats, making it a versatile choice. Leveraging the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, both components of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package, streamlines the conversion process in Python. <br><br>

The process involves two steps:

1. Load the Email content and render it into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET.
1. Load the converted HTML content using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it in the desired Word PDF format.

- Open the source Email file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your Email file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the Email is converted
