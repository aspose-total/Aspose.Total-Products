Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that can help Python developers automate the process of converting RTF to EMAIL. It is a comprehensive package of various APIs that can be used to deal with different file formats, including Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into an EMAIL format. This API package makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers. It is also highly reliable and secure, ensuring that the converted files are of the highest quality. Furthermore, the API package is regularly updated with new features and bug fixes, making it a great choice for developers looking to add a RTF to EMAIL conversion feature to their application.

- Open the source RTF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your RTF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the RTF is converted

- For RTF to EMAIL conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
