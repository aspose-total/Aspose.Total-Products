<h2>Why to Convert Email to DOTM?</h2>

Email is one of the most popular communication mediums used in the world today. It is used to send and receive messages, documents, and other files. However, the format of emails is not always compatible with other applications. This is why it is often necessary to convert emails into other formats, such as DOTM. DOTM is a Microsoft Word template format that can be used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. Converting emails into DOTM format allows them to be used in other applications, such as Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to DOTM Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make it easy to convert emails into DOTM format using Python. The process is a two-step process. Firstly, the email is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word DOTM format. This makes it easy for Python developers to add a EMAIL to DOTM conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source EMAIL file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted
