<h2>Why to Convert MSG to DOC</h2>

MSG is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by many applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert MSG files to a more widely supported format such as DOC. This allows users to access the content of the MSG file in other applications and share it with others.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MSG to DOC Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from MSG to DOC. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, which make it easy to convert MSG files to DOC format using Python. The process involves two steps: first, the MSG file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and then the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word DOC format. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert MSG files to DOC format.

- Open the source MSG file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MSG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MSG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MSG to DOC conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
