<h2>Why to Convert MBOX to EMF?</h2>

MBOX is a popular file format used to store emails. It is widely used by many email clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Eudora, etc. However, the MBOX format is not supported by many other applications. This is where the need to convert MBOX to EMF arises. EMF is a vector graphics format used by Microsoft Word and other applications. It is a more versatile format and can be used in a variety of applications.
