Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting a VCF file to a JPEG image. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make the conversion process easy. The process involves two steps. First, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word JPEG format. This package of APIs is a great tool for developers who need to quickly and easily convert VCF files to JPEG images.

- Open the source VCF file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your VCF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the VCF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For VCF to JPEG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
