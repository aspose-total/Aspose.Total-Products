<h2>Why to Convert SVG to MBOX</h2>

The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format is a vector image format that is widely used for creating and displaying graphics on the web. It is an XML-based format that is used to define vector-based graphics for the web. On the other hand, MBOX is a file format used by many email clients to store emails. It is a single file that contains all the emails of a particular mailbox. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to MBOX in order to view the SVG images in an email client.
