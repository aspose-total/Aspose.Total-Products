<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert TEXT to EMLX format arises when they are trying to add a feature within an application. EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail and is a combination of MIME and plain text. It is used to store email messages and is supported by various email clients. TEXT is a plain text format which is used to store data in a readable format. It is a popular format for storing data and is supported by many applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert TEXT to EMLX format in order to make the data readable and compatible with various email clients.
