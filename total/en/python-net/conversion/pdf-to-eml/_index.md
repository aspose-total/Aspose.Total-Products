<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert PDF to EML format via Python?</h2>

Converting PDF to EML format via Python is essential for transforming PDF documents into a format compatible with email systems. This conversion enables seamless sharing, storage, and email integration, making it valuable for document management, collaboration, and communication within Python applications.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total for Java can help in JSON to DXF Conversion?</h2>

For Python developers seeking to incorporate PDF to EML conversion in their applications, the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API streamlines the process. This comprehensive API bundle covers various formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. Notably, the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, part of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, simplify this conversion using Python. It involves two steps: initially, loading the PDF and rendering it as HTML with Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, followed by loading the converted HTML with Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saving it in EML format. This approach facilitates seamless PDF to EML conversion within Python applications.

- Open the source PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PDF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PDF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="PDF to EML Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For PDF to EML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
