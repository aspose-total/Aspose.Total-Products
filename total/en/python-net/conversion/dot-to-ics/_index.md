<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
For a Python developer, who is trying to add a DOT to ICS conversion feature within application, it is important to automate the conversion process. This is because the ICS format is widely used for calendar events and is supported by many applications. It is also a standard format for exchanging calendar information between different applications. 

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for dot to ics conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It contains two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion of DOT to ICS easy using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into ICS format. This process is automated and makes the conversion process easier and faster.

- Open the source DOT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOT to ICS conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
