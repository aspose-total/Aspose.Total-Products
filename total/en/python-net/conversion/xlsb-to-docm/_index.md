<h2>Why to Convert XLSB to DOCM?</h2>

XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel to store spreadsheet data. It is a compressed version of the XLSX file format and is used to reduce the size of the file. XLSB files are not compatible with other programs and can only be opened in Microsoft Excel. On the other hand, DOCM is a Microsoft Word document file format that is used to store documents with macros. It is a combination of the DOCX and XML file formats and is used to store documents with macros.

Converting XLSB to DOCM is necessary when a user wants to open the XLSB file in a program other than Microsoft Excel or when a user wants to add macros to the XLSB file.
