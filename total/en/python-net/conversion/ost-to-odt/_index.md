<h2>Why to Convert OST to ODT?</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert OST to ODT arises when they are trying to add a conversion feature within their application. OST is an Outlook data file which is used to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other Outlook items. ODT is an OpenDocument Text file format which is used to store text documents. ODT is an open standard and is supported by many applications, making it a more versatile format than OST. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OST to ODT in order to make the data more accessible and usable.
