<h2>Why to Convert POTX to DOCX?</h2>

However, PDFs are not editable, and if you need to make changes to the document, you need to convert it to a different format. Microsoft Word's DOCX format is a popular choice for editing documents, as it is widely used and supported by most word processing applications. Therefore, if you need to edit a document, you need to convert it from PDF to DOCX.
