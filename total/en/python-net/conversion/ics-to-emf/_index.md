<h2>Why to Convert ICS to EMF?</h2>

ICS (iCalendar) is a popular format for exchanging calendar information between different applications and services. It is widely used to store and share calendar information such as events, to-dos, and other calendar related data. However, ICS files are not supported by many applications and services, so it is necessary to convert them to other formats. One of the most popular formats for exchanging calendar information is EMF (Enhanced Metafile). EMF is a vector graphics format that is supported by many applications and services. Therefore, it is necessary to convert ICS to EMF in order to make the calendar information accessible to a wider range of applications and services.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for ICS to EMF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which can be used to automate the conversion process from ICS to EMF. It is a two step process, firstly load Email and render it into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it into respective Word EMF format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient using Python.

- Open the source ICS file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ICS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ICS is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ICS to EMF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
