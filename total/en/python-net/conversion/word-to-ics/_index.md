<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert Word files to ICS format?</h2>

Converting Word files to ICS (iCalendar) format is useful for creating calendar events based on the contents of the Word document. ICS format is a standard format used for exchanging calendar data between different applications and devices. Converting a Word document to ICS format extracts and formats the contents of the document as a calendar event. This allows easy import of the event into a calendar application such as Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar. Converting Word files to ICS format is convenient for creating and sharing calendar events, and saves time and effort by automatically formatting the document as a calendar event.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Word to ICS Conversion Requirements" %}}
To convert Word files to ICS format using Python, a minimum version of Python 3.5 is required. The required APIs, [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/), can be directly referenced from PyPI or installed using the *pip* command: `pip install aspose.words` and `pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET`. Additionally, the operating system should be either Microsoft Windows or Linux-based, and for Linux, there are additional requirements for gcc and libpython that must be met. Detailed system requirements and installation instructions are available in the documentation for both [Aspose.Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Aspose.Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)
