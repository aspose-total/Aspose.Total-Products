<h2>Why to Convert XLSB to DOTM?</h2>

XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel to store spreadsheet data. It is a compressed version of the XLSX file format and is used to reduce the size of the file. XLSB files are not compatible with other programs and can only be opened with Microsoft Excel. On the other hand, DOTM is a Microsoft Word template file format used to store document templates. It is used to create documents with the same formatting and layout. Converting XLSB to DOTM allows users to open the XLSB file in Microsoft Word and use the data in the file to create documents with the same formatting and layout.
