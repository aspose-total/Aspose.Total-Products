<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to PDF?</h2>
EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail. It is a plain text file that contains the email message and its attachments. It is not a widely used format and is not supported by many applications. PDF, on the other hand, is a widely used format and is supported by almost all applications. Converting EMLX to PDF makes it easier to share the email message with others, as it can be opened in any application that supports PDF.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted
