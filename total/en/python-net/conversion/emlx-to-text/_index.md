As a Python developer, if you are looking to add a EMLX to TEXT conversion feature within your application, [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help you automate the process. This package includes various APIs that can help you deal with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs, which are part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package, make the conversion process easy and efficient. The process involves two steps: firstly, you need to load the Email and render it into HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/). Secondly, you need to load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and save it into the respective Word TEXT format. With the help of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API, you can easily and quickly convert EMLX to TEXT format with Python.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMLX to TEXT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
