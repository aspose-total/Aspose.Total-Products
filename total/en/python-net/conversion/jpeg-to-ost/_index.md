Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developers to automate the conversion of JPEG to OST format within their applications. It includes the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process simple and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API, and secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into the OST format. This API package provides developers with a powerful and efficient way to convert JPEG to OST format quickly and easily.

- Open the source JPEG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your JPEG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the JPEG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For JPEG to OST conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
