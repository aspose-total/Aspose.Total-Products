<h2>Why to Convert Email to EMF</h2>

Email to EMF conversion is a process of converting emails into Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format. EMF is a vector graphics format that is used to store images and other graphical objects. It is a popular format for storing and sharing images, as it is highly compressed and can be easily shared over the internet. EMF files are also used in many applications, such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, and Corel Draw.

The main advantage of converting emails to EMF format is that it allows users to easily share emails with others. EMF files are much smaller in size than other image formats, making them easier to send over the internet. Additionally, EMF files are compatible with a wide range of applications, making them a great choice for sharing emails with others.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMAIL to EMF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET```
