<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
Converting DOT to MHTML (Web archive format) or HTMLFixed is a useful feature for a Python developer. It allows them to save the document in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements within the application. This is a great way to ensure that the document is preserved in its original form and can be easily shared with others.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOT to MHTML Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing with different formats. We use Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API, which is part of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET Package, to add the DOT to MHTML conversion feature. In case the DOT file is simple, it is just two lines of code. Load the DOT file and call the save method with the appropriate file path along with the SaveFormat enumeration as MHTML or HTML_FIXED. However, if there is a need to restore the document model as close to the original one, then there is a need to save some extra information within the resultant document called round-trip information.

- Load source DOT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [HtmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/)
- Set the export_roundtrip_information as True
- Specify the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/saveformat/) as MHTML
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat as parameters. So your DOT file is converted to MHTML at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOT to MHTML or HtmlFixed format conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
