<h2>Why to Convert PS to Email</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular file format used to store documents. It is widely used for sharing documents online, as it is easy to view and print. However, when it comes to sending documents via email, PDFs are not the most suitable format. This is because PDFs are not easily editable, and they can be difficult to read on some devices. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PDFs to other formats, such as email, in order to make them easier to share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to Email Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the conversion process from PDF to email. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make it easy to convert PDFs to email format using Python. The process is a two-step process: first, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, and then the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into an email format. This makes it easy to share documents via email, as they can be easily read and edited.

- Open the source PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PS is converted
