<h2>Why to Convert MSG to Word?</h2>

MSG is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other email clients. Therefore, it is necessary to convert MSG files to a more widely supported format such as Word. This will allow users to access the data stored in the MSG file without having to use Outlook.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MSG to Word Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from MSG to Word. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are specifically designed to handle different file formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient.

- Open the source MSG file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MSG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MSG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MSG to WORD conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
