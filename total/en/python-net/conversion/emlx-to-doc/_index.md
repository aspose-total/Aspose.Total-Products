<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to DOC?</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail, while DOC is a popular document format used by Microsoft Word. Converting EMLX to DOC allows users to view and edit emails in a more versatile format, as well as share them with other users who may not have access to Apple Mail.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted
