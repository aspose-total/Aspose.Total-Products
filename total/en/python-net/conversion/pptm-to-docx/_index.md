<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert PPTM to DOCX arises when a Python developer wants to add a feature within an application that allows users to convert PPTM files to DOCX. This is because DOCX is a more widely used format than PPTM, and thus it is more convenient for users to be able to convert their PPTM files to DOCX.
