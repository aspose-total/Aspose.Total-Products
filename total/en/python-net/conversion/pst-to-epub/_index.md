<h2>Why to Convert PST to EPUB?</h2>

PST (Personal Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by many other applications. On the other hand, EPUB (Electronic Publication) is an open standard format for digital books and publications. It is supported by many devices and applications, making it a popular choice for digital publications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PST files to EPUB format for wider compatibility.
