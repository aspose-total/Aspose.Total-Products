<h2>Why to Convert PPSM to XLS</h2>

The Portable Presentation Slide Master (PPSM) format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is used to store slide masters, which are collections of slide layouts, color schemes, and other design elements. However, the PPSM format is not supported by many other applications, making it difficult to share and collaborate on presentations. Converting PPSM to XLS format allows users to open and edit the presentation in other applications, such as Microsoft Excel.
