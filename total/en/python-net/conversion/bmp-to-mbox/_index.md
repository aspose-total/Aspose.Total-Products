<h2>Why to Convert BMP to MBOX?</h2>

The BMP format is a standard image format used for storing bitmap images. It is widely used for storing digital photos and other graphics. On the other hand, MBOX is a file format used for storing emails. It is a popular format used by many email clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and Microsoft Outlook. Converting BMP to MBOX allows users to store their emails in a more secure and organized manner.
