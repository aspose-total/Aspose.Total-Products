<h2>Why to Convert OST to EPUB</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OST to EPUB conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. OST is an Outlook data file that stores emails, contacts, tasks, calendars, and other items. It is used to store data locally on the computer, and is not compatible with other applications. EPUB is an open standard for digital books, and is widely used for e-books. It is supported by many devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. Therefore, it is important to convert OST files to EPUB format in order to make the data accessible to a wider audience.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OST is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OST to EPUB conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
