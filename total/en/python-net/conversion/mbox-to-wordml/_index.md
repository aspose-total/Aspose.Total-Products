<h2>Why to Convert MBOX to WORDML</h2>

The MBOX file format is used to store emails in a single file. It is a widely used format for storing emails, but it is not supported by Microsoft Word. Therefore, if a Python developer wants to view the emails stored in an MBOX file in a Word document, they need to convert the MBOX file to the WORDML format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MBOX to WORDML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help automate the conversion process from MBOX to WORDML. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the emails stored in the MBOX file are loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective WORDML format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers.

- Open the source MBOX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MBOX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MBOX is converted

- For MBOX to WORDML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
