<h2>Why to Convert Email to PNG</h2>
Email to PNG conversion is a useful feature for Python developers who are looking to add a conversion feature within their application. PNG is a popular image format that is widely used for web graphics and digital images. It is a lossless format that supports transparency and is widely used for logos, icons, and other graphics. Converting emails to PNG allows developers to easily create images from emails that can be used in their applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to PNG Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes it easy to convert emails to PNG using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word PNG format. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert emails to PNG using Python.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted
