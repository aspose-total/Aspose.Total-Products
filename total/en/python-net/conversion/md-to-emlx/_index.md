<h2>Why to Convert MD to EMLX?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert MD to EMLX format for various reasons. MD is a markdown format used for writing documents, while EMLX is an email format used by Apple Mail. Converting MD to EMLX allows developers to create emails from markdown documents, which can be used for various purposes.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to EMLX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from MD to EMLX. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total package. The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into EMLX format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers.

- Open the source MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MD file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MD is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MD to EMLX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
