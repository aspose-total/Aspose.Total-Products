Why to Convert

There can be different reasons to convert a DOTM file to OST. For example, a user may want to switch from Microsoft Outlook to some other email client that supports OST files. Or, a user may want to back up their emails in the OST format for safekeeping. Whatever the reason, Aspose.Total for Python via .NET can help developers automate the conversion process with just a few lines of code.

How Aspose.Total Helps for DOTM to OST Conversion

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs that deal with different file formats, including email, images, and Microsoft Word formats. The [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs that are part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package make it easy to convert DOTM files to OST with just a few lines of code.

The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/). Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and saved into the OST format.

- Open the source DOTM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOTM file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOTM is converted
