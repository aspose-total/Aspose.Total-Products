As a Python developer, if you are looking to add a feature to your application that will allow you to convert EML to WORD, then [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help you automate the process. This package contains various APIs that can help you deal with different formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word formats. The two APIs that are part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package that will help you with the conversion are [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/). The conversion process is a two-step process. First, you need to load the Email and render it into HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/). Then, you need to load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and save it into the respective Word WORD format. This API will help you automate the conversion process and make it easier for you to add the feature to your application.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to WORD conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
