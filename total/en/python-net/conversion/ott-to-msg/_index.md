<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert OTT (Outlook Template) files to MSG (Outlook Message) format. This is because MSG files are more widely used in the industry and are more compatible with different email clients. OTT files are not as widely used and are not as compatible with different email clients. Therefore, it is important for Python developers to be able to convert OTT files to MSG format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OTT to MSG Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs which makes the conversion of OTT to MSG files easy using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into MSG format. This makes the conversion process much easier and more efficient for Python developers.

- Open the source OTT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OTT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OTT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OTT to MSG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
