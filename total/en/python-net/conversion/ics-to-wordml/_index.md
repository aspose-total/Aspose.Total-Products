<h2>Why to Convert ICS to WORDML</h2>

ICS (iCalendar) is a popular format used to store calendar information such as events, to-dos, and journal entries. It is widely used by many calendar applications such as Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, etc. WORDML (WordprocessingML) is an XML-based format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a popular format for exchanging documents between different applications. Converting ICS to WORDML allows users to view and edit calendar information in Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for ICS to WORDML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs that make it easy to automate the conversion process from ICS to WORDML using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load Email and render it into HTML via [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/). Secondly load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and save it into respective Word WORDML format.

The [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) API provides a wide range of features to work with emails, such as loading and saving emails from various formats, creating and modifying emails, and converting emails to other formats. It also provides support for ICS format, allowing developers to easily load and save ICS files. The [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API provides a wide range of features to work with documents, such as loading and saving documents from various formats, creating and modifying documents, and converting documents to other formats. It also provides support for WORDML format, allowing developers to easily load and save WORDML files. 

By combining the features of both APIs, developers can easily automate the conversion process from ICS to WORDML using Python. This makes it easy for developers to add a ICS to WORDML conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source ICS file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ICS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ICS is converted
