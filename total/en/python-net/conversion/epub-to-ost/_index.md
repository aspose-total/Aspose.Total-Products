<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert EPUB files to OST format for various reasons. OST files are used to store emails, contacts, calendar items, and other data in Microsoft Outlook. It is a proprietary file format of Microsoft Outlook and is not supported by other email clients. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB files to OST format in order to use them in Microsoft Outlook.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to OST Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats such as Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two of the APIs that are part of the Aspose.Total package. These APIs make it easy to convert EPUB files to OST format using Python.

The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into OST format. This process is simple and efficient, and can be completed quickly with the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET.

- Open the source EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EPUB file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EPUB is converted
