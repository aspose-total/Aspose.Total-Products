<h2>Why to Convert Text to PST?</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert text to PST format may arise when they are trying to add a feature within their application that requires the conversion of text to PST. PST is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, calendar entries, and other data. It is a popular format for storing and archiving emails, and is often used for data migration and backup.
