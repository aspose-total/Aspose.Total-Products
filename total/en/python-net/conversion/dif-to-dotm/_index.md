<h2>Why to Convert DIF to DOTM?</h2>

Data Interchange Format (DIF) is a text-based file format used to exchange data between different spreadsheet applications. It is a simple format that is easy to read and write, but it does not support all the features of modern spreadsheet applications. On the other hand, Microsoft Word Template (DOTM) is a file format used to store a template for Microsoft Word documents. It is a powerful format that supports all the features of modern word processing applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert DIF files to DOTM format in order to take advantage of the features of modern word processing applications.
