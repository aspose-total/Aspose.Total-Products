Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer to automate the process of converting a DOC file to OFT format. It includes two APIs, namely "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" which can be used to achieve the desired result. The process involves two steps. Firstly, the Word file needs to be loaded and rendered into HTML using "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET". Secondly, the converted HTML needs to be loaded using "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" and saved into OFT format. 
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" package is a great tool for developers who are looking to add a DOC to OFT conversion feature within their application. It is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to convert Word documents into OFT format. The package also offers a wide range of other APIs which can be used to deal with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. This makes it a great choice for developers who are looking for a comprehensive solution for their conversion needs.

- Open the source DOC file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOC file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOC is converted

- For DOC to OFT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
