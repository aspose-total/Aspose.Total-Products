<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The CSV file format is a widely used format for storing tabular data. It is a plain text file that stores data in a tabular format, where each row is separated by a comma. However, the CSV format is not suitable for presentations. The PPSX format is a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation format that is used to store presentations. It is a compressed file format that stores slides, images, audio, and other multimedia elements. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CSV files to PPSX format for presentations.
