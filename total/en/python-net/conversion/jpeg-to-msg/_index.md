Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting JPEG to MSG format. It includes two APIs, namely "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET". The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET". Then, the converted HTML is loaded using "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" and saved into MSG format. 
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" package is easy to use and provides a reliable solution for converting JPEG to MSG format. It is a powerful tool that can help developers save time and effort when dealing with different file formats. Furthermore, the APIs are well-documented and provide detailed instructions on how to use them. This makes it easy for developers to quickly get up and running with the conversion process.

- Open the source JPEG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your JPEG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the JPEG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For JPEG to MSG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
