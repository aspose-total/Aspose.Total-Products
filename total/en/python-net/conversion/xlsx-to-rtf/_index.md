- **Step 1** Open the source XLSX file using Workbook class
- Save XLSX file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output RTF file path. So your XLSX file is converted to RTF at the specified path
