<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to EPUB</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail, while EPUB is an open source e-book format. Converting EMLX to EPUB allows users to read emails in an e-book format, which is more convenient and easier to read. It also allows users to share emails with others in a more accessible format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMLX to EPUB Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion of EMLX to EPUB easy using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load Email and render it into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it into respective Word EPUB format. This process can be automated using the API, which makes it easier for Python developers to add the feature of EMLX to EPUB conversion within their applications.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMLX to EPUB conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
