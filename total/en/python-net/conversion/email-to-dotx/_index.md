<h2>Why to Convert Email to DOTX?</h2>

Email is one of the most widely used communication mediums in the world. It is used to send and receive messages, documents, images, and other types of files. However, the format of emails is not always compatible with other applications. This is why it is often necessary to convert emails into other formats, such as DOTX, which is a Microsoft Word document template.
