<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to DOCM?</h2>

EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail to store emails. It is a plain text file that contains the email message, including the sender, recipient, subject, and date. On the other hand, DOCM is a Microsoft Word document format that supports macros. It is used to create documents with embedded macros that can be used to automate tasks. Converting EMLX to DOCM allows users to access the content of an email message in a Word document format, which can be used for further processing.
