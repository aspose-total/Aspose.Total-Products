<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to PST?</h2>

EPUB is a popular format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format for digital books and publications, which is supported by most of the e-book readers. PST is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, calendar, tasks, notes, journals, etc. It is a proprietary file format of Microsoft Outlook, which is not supported by other email clients. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to PST format in order to access the content of EPUB files in Microsoft Outlook.
