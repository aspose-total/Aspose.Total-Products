Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting ODT to VCF. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into VCF format. This API package is ideal for developers who need to quickly and easily convert ODT to VCF without any hassle. It is also highly reliable and secure, ensuring that the converted files are of the highest quality. With Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, developers can save time and effort while still achieving the desired results.

- Open the source ODT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ODT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ODT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ODT to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
