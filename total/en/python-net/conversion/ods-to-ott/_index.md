<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
Python developers often need to convert ODS files to OTT format for various reasons. ODS is an open document spreadsheet format, which is used to store tabular data. It is an open standard maintained by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). On the other hand, OTT is a Microsoft Word template format, which is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is a proprietary format developed by Microsoft and is not an open standard. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert ODS files to OTT format in order to make them compatible with Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for ods to ott conversion</h2>

- **Step 1** Open the source ODS file using Workbook class
- Save ODS file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output OTT file path. So your ODS file is converted to OTT at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ODS to OTT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/) and [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-cells-python``` and ```pip install aspose.words```
-  Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Cells](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/python-net/getting-started/#installation) and [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow [step by step instructions](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
