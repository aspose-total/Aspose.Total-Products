<h2>Why to Convert ICS to DOTM?</h2>

ICS (iCalendar) is a widely used format for exchanging calendar information between different applications. It is used to store calendar events, tasks, and other related information. DOTM is a Microsoft Word template file format used to store document templates. It is used to create documents with the same formatting and styles. Converting ICS to DOTM allows users to view calendar events in a more organized and presentable manner.
