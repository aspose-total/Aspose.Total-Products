<h2>Why to Convert JPEG to EMLX?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert JPEG to EMLX format for various reasons. For example, if an application requires to send emails with attachments, then the attachments need to be in EMLX format. JPEG is a popular image format, but it is not suitable for email attachments. Therefore, it is necessary to convert JPEG to EMLX format before sending the email.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JPEG to EMLX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers to automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two of the APIs that are part of the Aspose.Total package. These APIs can be used to convert JPEG to EMLX format in a two-step process. 

The first step is to load the Word file and render it into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. The second step is to load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into EMLX format. This process is simple and efficient, and it can be easily automated using Python. Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a great tool for Python developers who need to convert JPEG to EMLX format.

- Open the source JPEG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your JPEG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the JPEG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For JPEG to EMLX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
