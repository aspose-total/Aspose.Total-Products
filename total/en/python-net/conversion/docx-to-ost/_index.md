<h2>Why to Convert DOCX to OST?</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert a DOCX file to OST format may arise when they are trying to add a feature within their application. OST files are used to store data in an offline mode, which is not possible with DOCX files. This makes it necessary to convert DOCX to OST format in order to store the data in an offline mode.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOCX to OST Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It consists of two APIs, namely Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion of DOCX to OST easy using Python. The conversion process is a two step process, firstly loading the Word file and rendering it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, loading the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saving it into OST format. This makes it easier for the Python developer to add the feature of DOCX to OST conversion within their application.

- Open the source DOCX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOCX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOCX is converted

- For DOCX to OST conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
