Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting ICS to DOC. It includes the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the ICS file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API and saved into the desired DOC format. This process can be easily automated using Python, making it a great choice for developers who are looking to add a ICS to DOC conversion feature to their applications.

- Open the source ICS file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ICS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ICS is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ICS to DOC conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
