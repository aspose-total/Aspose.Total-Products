As a Python developer, if you are looking for a way to add a EMLX to RTF conversion feature within your application, then [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help you automate the process. This package contains various APIs that can help you deal with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, you need to use [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) to load the Email and render it into HTML. Secondly, you need to use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) to load the converted HTML and save it into the respective Word RTF format. With the help of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/), you can easily and quickly convert EMLX to RTF format using Python. It is a reliable and efficient solution that can help you save time and effort in the conversion process.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMLX to RTF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
