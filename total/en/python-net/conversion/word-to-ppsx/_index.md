<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Microsoft Word is one of the most popular document formats used for creating and editing documents. It is widely used in both personal and professional settings. However, it is not always the best format for sharing documents. For example, when sharing documents with a large audience, it is often preferable to use a presentation format such as PPSX. This is because PPSX is more visually appealing and easier to navigate than a Word document.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for Word to PPSX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is an API package that provides developers with the tools they need to automate the conversion of Microsoft Word documents to PPSX presentations. The API package is comprised of two APIs: Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET. 

The first step in the conversion process is to use Aspose.Words for Python via .NET to convert the Word document to a PDF. This API provides developers with the ability to convert Word documents to PDFs quickly and easily. Once the Word document has been converted to a PDF, the second step is to use Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET to save the PDF as a PPSX presentation. This API provides developers with the ability to save PDFs as PPSX presentations with ease. 

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is an API package that provides developers with the tools they need to automate the conversion of Microsoft Word documents to PPSX presentations. The API package is comprised of two APIs: Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET. By using these two APIs, developers can quickly and easily convert Word documents to PPSX presentations.

- **Step 1** Open the source WORD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
	- Save WORD file to PDF by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/save/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path.
-  **Step 2** Load PDF file with an instance of [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class
	-  Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat.PPSX as parameters. So your WORD file is converted to PPSX at the specified path.
