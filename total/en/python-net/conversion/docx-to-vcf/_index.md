<h2>Why to Convert DOCX to VCF?</h2>

The DOCX format is a Microsoft Word document format, while VCF is a standard format for storing contact information. Converting DOCX to VCF allows users to store contact information in a standard format, which can be easily shared and imported into other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOCX to VCF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion of DOCX to VCF easy using Python. It's a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into VCF format. This process can be automated using the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API, which makes it easier for Python developers to add the DOCX to VCF conversion feature within their applications.

- Open the source DOCX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOCX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOCX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOCX to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
