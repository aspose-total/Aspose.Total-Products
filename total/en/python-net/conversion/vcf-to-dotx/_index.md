<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
For a Python developer, who is trying to add a VCF to DOTX conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. VCF (Virtual Contact File) is a file format used to store contact information such as name, address, phone number, email address, etc. It is widely used to store contact information in an electronic form. DOTX (Document Template) is a Microsoft Word document template used to create new documents. It is used to store the formatting and layout of a document, including text, images, tables, and other elements. Converting VCF to DOTX allows users to store contact information in a document template, making it easier to access and manage.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your VCF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the VCF is converted
