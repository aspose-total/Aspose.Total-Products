<h2>Why to Convert DOTX to MSG?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert DOTX files to MSG format for various reasons. DOTX is a template file format used by Microsoft Word, while MSG is an email message format used by Microsoft Outlook. Converting DOTX to MSG allows the user to send the template as an email message, which can be used to quickly create emails with the same formatting and content.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOTX to MSG Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which can be used to convert DOTX to MSG. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, and secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into MSG format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient.

- Open the source DOTX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOTX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOTX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOTX to MSG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
