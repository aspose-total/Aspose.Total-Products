Why to Convert

There are many reasons to convert a DOTM file to MHTML. One reason is that MHTML is a more widely used format. MHTML, or web archive format, is a single file format that combines HTML and images into one file. This can be helpful when you want to save a web page or email for later viewing. MHTML files are often used for archiving web pages and emails.

Another reason to convert a DOTM file to MHTML is that MHTML files are smaller in size than DOTM files. This can be helpful if you want to save space on your computer or email attachments. MHTML files are also more likely to be compatible with different browsers and email clients than DOTM files.

How Aspose.Total helps for dotm to mhtml conversion

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. We use Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API that is part of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET Package to add the DOTM to MHTML conversion feature. In case the DOTM file is simple then its just two lines of code. Load the DOTM file and call the save method with appropriate file path along with SaveFormat enumeration as MHTML or HTML_FIXED. But in case if there is need to restore the document model as close to original one then there is need to save some extra information within resultant document called round-trip information.

- Load source DOTM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [HtmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/)
- Set the export_roundtrip_information as True
- Specify the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/saveformat/) as MHTML
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat as parameters. So your DOTM file is converted to MHTML at the specified path
