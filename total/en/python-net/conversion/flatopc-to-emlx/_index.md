<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert files from one format to another. For example, they may need to convert a FLATOPC file to an EMLX file. FLATOPC is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook, while EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail. Converting between these two formats can be a difficult and time-consuming process, but it is necessary in order to ensure compatibility between different email clients.
