For a Python developer, who is trying to add a PPSX to XLS conversion feature within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including PPSX and XLS files.

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) API to convert PPSX file to HTML. After that by using Excel Python API [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/), save the created HTML into desired Microsoft Excel format.

- **Step 1** Use [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class instance to open the source PPSX file 
- Save PPSX file to HTML by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of Workbook class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output XLS file path. So your PPSX file is converted to XLS at the specified path
