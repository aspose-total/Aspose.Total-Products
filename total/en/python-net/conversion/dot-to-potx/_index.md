- **Step 1** Open the source DOT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
	- Save DOT file to PDF by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/save/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path.
-  **Step 2** Load PDF file with an instance of [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class
	-  Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat.POTX as parameters. So your DOT file is converted to POTX at the specified path.
