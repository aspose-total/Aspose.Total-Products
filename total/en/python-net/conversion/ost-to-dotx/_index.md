<h2>Why to Convert OST to DOTX?</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OST to DOTX conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. OST (Offline Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, calendar items, tasks, notes, etc. on the local computer. DOTX (Word Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents as templates. It is a combination of XML and other binary data. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OST to DOTX in order to use the data stored in OST file in Microsoft Word.

- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OST is converted
