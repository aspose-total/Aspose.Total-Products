<h2>Why to Convert Email to SVG</h2>

Email to SVG conversion is a useful process for Python developers who are looking to add a feature to their application. SVG is a vector image format that is widely used for web graphics and is supported by all modern web browsers. It is also a great choice for creating logos, icons, and other graphics. Converting an email to SVG allows developers to create a visually appealing and interactive experience for their users.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to SVG Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make it easy to convert emails to SVG. The process involves two steps: first, the email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and then the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective SVG format. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert emails to SVG.

- Open the source EMAIL file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted

- For EMAIL to SVG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
