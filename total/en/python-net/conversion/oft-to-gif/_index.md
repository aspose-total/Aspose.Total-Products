<h2>Why to Convert OFT to GIF?</h2>

The GIF format is a popular image format used for web graphics, and is widely supported by web browsers. It is also a lossless format, meaning that no data is lost when the image is compressed. For this reason, it is often used for storing images with large amounts of detail, such as logos or illustrations. Converting an OFT file to a GIF can be useful for web developers who need to display images on their websites.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted
