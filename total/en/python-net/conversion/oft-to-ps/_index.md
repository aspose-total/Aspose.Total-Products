<h2>Why to Convert OFT to PS?</h2>

The Outlook File Template (OFT) format is used to create email messages in Microsoft Outlook. It is a text-based file format that stores the content of an email message, including the body, attachments, and other information. However, the OFT format is not supported by other email clients, so it is necessary to convert it to a more widely accepted format such as Portable Document Format (PS).
