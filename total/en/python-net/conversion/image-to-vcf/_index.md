Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the process of converting an IMAGE file to a VCF file. It includes "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET", and then the converted HTML is loaded using "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" and saved into VCF format. 
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" package is a great tool for Python developers who need to convert IMAGE files to VCF files. It is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to automate the conversion process. Furthermore, the package also provides APIs for dealing with other formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. With the help of this package, Python developers can easily and quickly convert IMAGE files to VCF files, making the task of adding a IMAGE to VCF conversion feature within application much easier.

- Open the source IMAGE file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your IMAGE file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the IMAGE is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For IMAGE to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
