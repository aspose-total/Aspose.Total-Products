<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a Python developer, it is important to be able to convert Microsoft Word DOTM documents to MHTML and HtmlFixed formats. This is because MHTML and HtmlFixed formats are more widely used and supported by web browsers, making it easier to share documents online. Additionally, MHTML and HtmlFixed formats are more secure than other formats, as they are less vulnerable to malicious code.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to DOTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of various APIs that can help automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, which makes it easy to export and import MHTML, PDF and various other formats using Python. The API also allows developers to save documents in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements. This makes it easier to share documents online, as well as ensuring that the documents are secure and less vulnerable to malicious code. Additionally, Aspose.Total for Python via .NET also provides support for other formats, such as Microsoft Word, making it a great choice for developers looking to convert DOTM documents to MHTML and HtmlFixed formats.

- Open the source MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path as parameter. So your MHTML file is converted to DOTM at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MHTML to DOTM conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
