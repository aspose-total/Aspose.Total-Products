<h2>Why to Convert PST to Word?</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a PST to WORD conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. PST files are used to store emails, contacts, calendar entries, and other data in a single file. This makes it easier to transfer data between different email clients. However, PST files are not compatible with Microsoft Word, which is the most popular word processing software. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PST files to Word format in order to use them in Word documents.
