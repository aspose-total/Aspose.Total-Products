<h2>Why to Convert PS to PST?</h2>

The PostScript (PS) format is a page description language used mainly in desktop publishing applications. It is a vector-based language, which means that it is resolution-independent and can be scaled to any size without losing quality. On the other hand, the Personal Storage Table (PST) format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, calendar items, and other data. PST files are used to back up Outlook data and to transfer data between computers. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PS files to PST format in order to access the data in Outlook.

- Open the source PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
