<h2>Why to Convert MBOX to BMP?</h2>

The MBOX format is a popular format for storing emails, but it is not suitable for viewing or editing. For this purpose, it is necessary to convert MBOX to a more suitable format such as BMP. BMP is a popular image format that can be easily viewed and edited.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MBOX to BMP Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the conversion process from MBOX to BMP. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make the conversion process easy. The process involves two steps: firstly, the email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word BMP format. This makes it possible to quickly and easily convert MBOX to BMP using Python.

- Open the source MBOX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MBOX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MBOX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MBOX to BMP conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
