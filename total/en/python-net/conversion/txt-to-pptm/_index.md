<h2>Why to Convert TXT to PPTM?</h2>

TXT files are plain text files that contain only text and no formatting. They are widely used for storing data and transferring data between different applications. However, when it comes to presenting data, TXT files are not suitable as they lack the formatting and styling options that are available in other formats such as PPTM. PPTM is a presentation format that is used by Microsoft PowerPoint and is widely used for creating presentations. It allows users to add formatting, styling, images, animations, and other features to their presentations. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert TXT files to PPTM in order to create a more visually appealing presentation.
