For a Python developer looking to add a DOCM to PNG, BMP, TIFF, JPEG and GIF Images conversion feature to their application, [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API is the perfect solution. This full package of various APIs deals with different formats, and the [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API is the perfect tool for this task. 

The conversion process is simple and straightforward, requiring only two lines of code. The first line loads the DOCM file, and the second line calls the save method with the appropriate image path and SaveFormat of the relevant format. However, if extra information needs to be set, such as horizontal and vertical resolution, scale, pixel format, brightness, and more, then the [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) class can be used. This class allows for a specific DOCM page to be rendered into an image with a transparent or colored background, a resolution to be specified while rendering, compression to be configured, and more. 

For those who need more options, [Word To Image](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/conversion/word-to-image/) conversion is also available. With this method, developers can easily add the DOCM to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and TIFF Images conversion feature to their application.

- Load source DOCM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/)
- Specify page number for conversion using [PageSet](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pageset/)
- Set the properties
- Call the `save` method while passing output file path & specified options as parameters. So your DOCM file is converted to Images at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOCM to Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF) conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
