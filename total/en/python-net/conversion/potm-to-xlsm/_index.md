For a Python developer, who is trying to add a POTM to XLSM conversion feature within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including POTM and XLSM files.

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) API to convert POTM file to HTML. After that by using Excel Python API [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/), save the created HTML into desired Microsoft Excel format.

- **Step 1** Use [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class instance to open the source POTM file 
- Save POTM file to HTML by using [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of Workbook class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output XLSM file path. So your POTM file is converted to XLSM at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For POTM to XLSM conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Slides](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Slides/) and [Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.slides``` and ```pip install aspose-cells-python```
