<h2>Why to Convert DOC to EMLX?</h2>

DOC is a popular file format used to store documents created by Microsoft Word. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by many other applications. EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail. It is an XML-based format and is used to store emails in a structured format. Converting DOC to EMLX can help to make the documents compatible with Apple Mail.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOC to EMLX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help to automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two APIs that are part of the Aspose.Total package and can be used to convert DOC to EMLX. The process involves two steps, firstly loading the Word file and rendering it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, loading the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saving it into EMLX format. This process can be automated using Python and Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOC file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOC is converted
