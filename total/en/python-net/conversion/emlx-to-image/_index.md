<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to Image?</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail, the default email client for Mac OS X. It is a plain text file that contains the email message, including the sender, recipient, subject, and message body. However, it is not compatible with other email clients and cannot be opened in other programs. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EMLX to an image format such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF in order to make it accessible to other users.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for EMLX to Image Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from EMLX to image. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which are both part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient using Python.

The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the EMLX file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the desired image format. This process is quick and efficient, and can be used to convert multiple EMLX files into image formats in a short amount of time.

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a powerful and reliable API that can help developers automate the conversion process from EMLX to image. It is easy to use and efficient, and can be used to quickly convert multiple EMLX files into image formats.

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMLX to IMAGE conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
