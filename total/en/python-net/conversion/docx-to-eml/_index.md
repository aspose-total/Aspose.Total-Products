Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting a DOCX file to an EML file. It includes the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process easy. The conversion process is a two-step process. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into the EML format.
The "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" package is a great tool for Python developers who need to convert DOCX files to EML files. It is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to automate the conversion process. With the help of the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, the conversion process is quick and simple. The two-step process of loading the Word file and rendering it into HTML, followed by loading the converted HTML and saving it into the EML format, makes the conversion process straightforward and efficient.

- Open the source DOCX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOCX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOCX is converted

- For DOCX to EML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
