<h2>Why to Convert WordML to Email?</h2>

WordML is a markup language used to represent Microsoft Word documents. It is an XML-based format that is used to store and transport documents. It is a great way to store documents in a format that is easily readable and transportable. However, when it comes to sending emails, WordML is not the best format to use. Email messages need to be in a format that is easily readable and transportable, and WordML does not provide this. Therefore, it is necessary to convert WordML to Email in order to send emails.
