For a Python developer, who is trying to add a WORDML to EMAIL conversion feature within application? [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs that are part of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package makes this conversion easy using Python.

Secondly load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and save it into EMAIL format.

- Open the source WORDML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your WORDML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the WORDML is converted
