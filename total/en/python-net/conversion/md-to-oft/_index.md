<h2>Why to Convert MD to OFT?</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a MD to OFT conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and is often used to convert plain text into HTML for web-based publishing. On the other hand, OFT (Outlook Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages, contact details, calendar events, and other Outlook items. OFT files are used to create email templates that can be used to quickly compose emails with the same formatting and content. Therefore, it is important to convert MD to OFT in order to use the content in Microsoft Outlook.
