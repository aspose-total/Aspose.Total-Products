<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to GIF?</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail. It is a plain text file that contains the email message, including the sender, recipient, subject, and message body. On the other hand, GIF is a popular image format used for displaying images on the web. It is a compressed image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel and is widely used for web graphics.
