<h2>Why to Convert PS to EMLX?</h2>

The PostScript (PS) format is a page description language used mainly in the printing and publishing industry. It is a vector-based language that describes the appearance of a printed page in terms of shapes, text, and images. On the other hand, EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail. It is a plain text file that stores the email message and its attachments. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PS to EMLX in order to view the content of the PS file in Apple Mail.

- Open the source PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PS is converted
