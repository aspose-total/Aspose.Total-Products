<h2>Why to Convert ODT to EMLX?</h2>

ODT (OpenDocument Text) is a file format used to store text documents. It is an open standard developed by the Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF) and is used by many applications such as LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and Apache OpenOffice. On the other hand, EMLX is a file format used to store emails. It is an open standard developed by Apple Inc. and is used by Apple Mail. Converting ODT to EMLX is useful for developers who need to transfer emails from one platform to another.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ODT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ODT is converted
