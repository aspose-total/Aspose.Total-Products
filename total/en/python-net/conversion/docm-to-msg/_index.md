<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting a DOCM file to MSG format can be beneficial for a Python developer who is trying to add a DOCM to MSG conversion feature within an application. MSG format is a popular email format used by Microsoft Outlook and other email clients. It is a binary file format that stores email messages, contacts, appointments, tasks, notes, journals, posts, and other items. It is also used to store files and folders on the computer. Converting a DOCM file to MSG format can help to store the data in a more secure and organized manner.
