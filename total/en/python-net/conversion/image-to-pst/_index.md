<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert images to PST format arises when a Python developer is trying to add a feature within an application that requires the conversion of images to PST format. PST is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, and other items. It is a popular format for storing emails and other data, and is widely used by businesses and individuals alike.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Image to PST Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word formats. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two APIs that are part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package. These APIs make it easy to convert images to PST format using Python. The process involves two steps: first, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Then, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into PST format.

- Open the source IMAGE file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your IMAGE file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the IMAGE is converted
