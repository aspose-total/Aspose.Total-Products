<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OST to FLATOPC conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. OST (Offline Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other Outlook items on the local hard drive. FLATOPC is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents in a single file. It is a compressed version of the Open XML format and is used to reduce the size of the document. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OST to FLATOPC in order to make the documents more compact and easier to store and share.
