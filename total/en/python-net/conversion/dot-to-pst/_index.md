<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOT file format is a text-based file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by many other applications. PST is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, and other data. It is a more widely used format and is supported by many other applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert DOT files to PST format in order to make the data more widely accessible.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOT to PST Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that make it easy to automate the conversion process from DOT to PST using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into PST format. This makes it easy for Python developers to add a DOT to PST conversion feature within their applications.

- Open the source DOT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOT to PST conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
