<h2>Why to Convert PCL to EMLX?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert PCL (Printer Command Language) files to EMLX (Apple Mail Email) format. PCL is a page description language used by printers to describe the page layout and graphics. It is a language that is used to control the printer and is not easily readable by humans. EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail to store emails. It is an XML-based format that is used to store email messages, including attachments, in a single file. Converting PCL to EMLX allows the user to view the PCL file in Apple Mail.

- Open the source PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PCL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PCL is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For PCL to EMLX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
