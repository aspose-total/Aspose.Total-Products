<h2>Why to Convert Email to PS?</h2>

Email to PS conversion is a useful feature for Python developers who are looking to add a conversion feature within their application. It allows users to convert emails into the PostScript (PS) format, which is a page description language used to create documents for printing. This is especially useful for applications that require documents to be printed in a specific format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to PS Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing with different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion process easy using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word PS format. This makes it easy for developers to add the conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source EMAIL file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted

- For EMAIL to PS conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
