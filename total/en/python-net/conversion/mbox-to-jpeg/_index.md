<h2>Why to Convert MBOX to JPEG?</h2>

MBOX is a popular file format used to store emails. It is widely used by email clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and Microsoft Outlook. However, MBOX files are not compatible with many other applications, such as image editing programs. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert MBOX files to JPEG format in order to use them in other applications.

- Open the source MBOX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MBOX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MBOX is converted
