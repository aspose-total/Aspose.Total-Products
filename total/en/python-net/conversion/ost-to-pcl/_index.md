<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert OST to PCL format for various reasons. OST is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. PCL is a page description language used by printers to control the printing process. It is a widely used format for printing documents, and is supported by many printers. Converting OST to PCL allows users to print their emails and other Outlook data in a format that is compatible with most printers.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for ost to pcl conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help Python developers automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats, including Email, Images, and Microsoft Word. Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET are two APIs that are part of the Aspose.Total package that make it easy to convert OST to PCL using Python. The process involves two steps: first, load the Email and render it into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, and then load the converted HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it into the respective Word PCL format. This process can be automated using Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, making it easy for Python developers to convert OST to PCL.

- Open the source OST file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OST is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OST to PCL conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
