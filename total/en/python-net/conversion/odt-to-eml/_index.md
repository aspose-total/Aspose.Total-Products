<h2>Why to Convert ODT to EML?</h2>

ODT (OpenDocument Text) is a file format used by the open source office suite, OpenOffice.org, and other applications. It is a text document format that is based on the XML standard and is used for creating and storing documents. EML (Electronic Mail) is a file format used for storing emails. It is a text-based format that is used for storing emails in a plain text format. Converting ODT to EML can be useful for developers who want to store emails in a text-based format.

- Open the source ODT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ODT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ODT is converted
