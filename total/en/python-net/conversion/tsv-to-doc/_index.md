For a Python developer, who is trying to add a TSV to DOC conversion feature within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including TSV and DOC files.

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/) API to convert TSV file to HTML. After that by using Word Python API [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/), save the created HTML into desired Microsoft Word format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="How to Convert TSV to DOC in Python" %}}
- **Step 1** Open the source TSV file using Workbook class
- Save TSV file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output DOC file path. So your TSV file is converted to DOC at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For TSV to DOC conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/) and [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-cells-python``` and ```pip install aspose.words```
-  Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Cells](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/python-net/getting-started/#installation) and [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow [step by step instructions](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
