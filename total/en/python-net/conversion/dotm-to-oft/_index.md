Why to Convert

There can be various reasons to convert a DOTM file to an OFT file. For example, a user may want to open a DOTM file in Outlook but they do not have Microsoft Word installed on their system. In such cases, converting the DOTM file to an OFT file can be helpful. Additionally, a DOTM file may be corrupt and a user may not be able to open it. In such cases, converting the file to an OFT file can help to repair the file.
