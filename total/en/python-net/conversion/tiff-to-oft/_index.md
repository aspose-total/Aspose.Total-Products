<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster image format used for storing high-quality images. It is widely used in the printing and publishing industry. OFT (Outlook File Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages. It is used to store email messages in a structured format. Converting TIFF to OFT can be useful for a Python developer who wants to add a feature to their application that allows users to convert TIFF images to OFT files.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TIFF to OFT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that make it easy to convert TIFF to OFT using Python. It is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into OFT format. This makes it easy to automate the conversion process.

- Open the source TIFF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your TIFF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the TIFF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For TIFF to OFT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
