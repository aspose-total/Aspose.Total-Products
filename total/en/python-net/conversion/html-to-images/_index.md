As a Python developer, adding a feature to convert HTML to PNG, BMP, TIFF, JPEG and GIF Images within an application can be easily achieved with the help of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API. This package provides a full suite of APIs to deal with different file formats, and the conversion process can be automated with just two lines of code. 
The [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API, which is part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package, can be used to convert HTML to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and TIFF Images. To do this, the HTML file needs to be loaded and the save method needs to be called with the appropriate image path and SaveFormat of the relevant format. 
In addition, the [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) class can be used to set extra information such as horizontal and vertical resolution, scale, pixel format, brightness and more. This class can also be used to render a specific HTML page into an image with a transparent or colored background, specify a resolution while rendering, configure compression and more. 
Alternatively, [Word To Image](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/conversion/word-to-image/) conversion can also be used to achieve the desired result. With the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API, developers can easily add the HTML to PNG, BMP, TIFF, JPEG and GIF Images conversion feature within their application.

- Load source HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/)
- Specify page number for conversion using [PageSet](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pageset/)
- Set the properties
- Call the `save` method while passing output file path & specified options as parameters. So your HTML file is converted to Images at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For HTML to Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF) conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
