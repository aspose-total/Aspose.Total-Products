For a Python developer, who is trying to add a HTML to PNG, BMP, TIFF, JPEG and GIF Images conversion feature within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to import and export images and Word files as well as to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. 

We use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API that is part of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) Package to add the HTML to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and TIFF Images conversion feature. For just conversion it's just two lines of code. Load the HTML file and call the save method with appropriate image path along with SaveFormat of relevant format. But in case if there is need to set extra information like setting horizental and vertical resolution, scale, pixel format, brightness and more, then there is [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) class to be used for all these. Using [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) one can easily renders a specific HTML page into an image with transparent or colored background, specify a resolution while rendering, configure compression and more. Depending on the requirement, one can use as of his requirement, Here is another way for [Word To Image](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/conversion/word-to-image/) conversion.

- Load source HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/)
- Specify page number for conversion using [PageSet](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pageset/)
