<h2>Why to Convert OST to DOCX</h2>
For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OST to DOCX conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. OST (Offline Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other Outlook items on the local hard drive. It is an offline version of the user's mailbox stored on the Exchange server. On the other hand, DOCX is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is an XML-based format that stores documents in a compressed form. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OST to DOCX in order to access the Outlook data in a format that can be used by Microsoft Word.
