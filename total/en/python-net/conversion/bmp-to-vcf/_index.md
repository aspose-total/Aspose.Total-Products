Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting a BMP to VCF format. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make the conversion process easy and efficient. The conversion process involves two steps. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. This API provides a wide range of features such as document manipulation, formatting, and conversion. It also allows developers to create, edit, and save documents in various formats. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into VCF format. This API provides features such as email manipulation, message conversion, and email address validation.

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a great tool for Python developers who are looking to add a BMP to VCF conversion feature within their application. It is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient conversion process. The APIs are also highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor the conversion process to their specific needs. Furthermore, the APIs are well-documented, making it easy for developers to understand and use them. With Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, developers can quickly and easily add a BMP to VCF conversion feature to their applications.

- Open the source BMP file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your BMP file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the BMP is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For BMP to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
