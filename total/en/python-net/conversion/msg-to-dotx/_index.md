<h2>Why to Convert MSG to DOTX?</h2>

MSG is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other email clients. DOTX is a Microsoft Word template format that is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is a more versatile format and can be used by other applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert MSG files to DOTX format for better compatibility.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MSG to DOTX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, which can be used to convert MSG files to DOTX format. The process involves two steps. Firstly, the MSG file is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and rendered into HTML. Secondly, the HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective DOTX format. This makes it easy for developers to convert MSG files to DOTX format using Python.

- Open the source MSG file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MSG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MSG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MSG to DOTX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
