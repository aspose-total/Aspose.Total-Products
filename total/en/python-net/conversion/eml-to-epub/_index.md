<h2>Why to Convert EML to EPUB?</h2>

EML (Electronic Mail) is a popular file format used for storing emails. It is widely used by many email clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc. EPUB (Electronic Publication) is an open standard format for e-books and digital publications. It is supported by many e-book readers such as Apple iBooks, Kobo, Barnes & Noble Nook, etc. Converting EML to EPUB allows users to read emails in the form of e-books. This makes it easier to read emails on various devices and platforms.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to EPUB conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
