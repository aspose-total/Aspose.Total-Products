<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The FLATOPC format is a proprietary format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is not a widely used format and is not supported by many applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert FLATOPC to EML format in order to make the document accessible to a wider range of applications. EML is a widely used email format and is supported by many email clients.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for flatopc to eml conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/), which can be used to automate the conversion process from FLATOPC to EML. The conversion process is a two step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/). Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and saved into EML format. This process is easy to implement using Python and can be used to quickly convert FLATOPC to EML.

- Open the source FLATOPC file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your FLATOPC file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the FLATOPC is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For FLATOPC to EML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
