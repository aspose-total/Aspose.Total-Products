Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer to automate the process of converting a PNG to OFT format. It includes APIs for dealing with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into OFT format. This API package is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to convert a PNG to OFT format. It also offers a wide range of features such as the ability to convert multiple files at once, support for various image formats, and the ability to customize the output.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PNG file is converted to HTML at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For PNG to OFT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
