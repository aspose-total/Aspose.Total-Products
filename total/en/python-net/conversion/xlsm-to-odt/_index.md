For a Python developer, who is trying to add a XLSM to ODT conversion feature within application. [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including XLSM and ODT files.

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/) API to convert XLSM file to HTML. After that by using Word Python API [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/), save the created HTML into desired Microsoft Word format.

- **Step 1** Open the source XLSM file using Workbook class
- Save XLSM file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output ODT file path. So your XLSM file is converted to ODT at the specified path
