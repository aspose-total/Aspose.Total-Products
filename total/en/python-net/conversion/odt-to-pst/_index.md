<h2>Why to Convert ODT to PST?</h2>

OpenDocument Text (ODT) is a file format used for word processing documents, such as those created by OpenOffice or LibreOffice. It is an open standard for document exchange and is based on the XML format. PST (Personal Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, notes, and other Outlook items. It is a proprietary file format developed by Microsoft and is used to store data locally on a user's computer. Converting ODT to PST is necessary when a user wants to access their ODT documents in Microsoft Outlook.
