<h2>Why to Convert Email to DOCM?</h2>

Email is one of the most popular communication mediums used in the world today. It is used to send and receive messages, documents, and other files. However, emails are not always the most convenient format for viewing and editing documents. This is why many people choose to convert their emails to DOCM format, which is a Microsoft Word document format. DOCM files are easier to view and edit, and they can be shared with others more easily.
