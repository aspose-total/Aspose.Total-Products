<h2>Why to Convert DOCM to VCF?</h2>

DOCM is a Microsoft Word document format that is used to store documents with macros. It is a binary file format that is not supported by many applications. VCF, or vCard, is a file format used to store contact information. It is a widely accepted format and is supported by many applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert DOCM files to VCF format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOCM to VCF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, that can be used to automate the conversion process. It is a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and save it into VCF format. This makes the conversion process easy and efficient.

- Open the source DOCM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOCM file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOCM is converted

- For DOCM to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
