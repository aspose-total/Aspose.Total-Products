<h2>Why to Convert XLSB to OTT</h2>

XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel to store spreadsheet data. It is a compressed version of the XLSX file format and is used to reduce the size of the file. OTT is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a compressed version of the DOCX file format and is used to reduce the size of the file. Converting XLSB to OTT allows users to access the data stored in the XLSB file in a format that is compatible with Microsoft Word.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XLSB to OTT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from XLSB to OTT. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats, including XLSB and OTT files. The conversion process is done in two steps. Firstly, the XLSB file is converted to HTML using the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API. Then, the created HTML is saved into the desired Microsoft Word format using the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API. This process allows developers to quickly and easily convert XLSB files to OTT files.
