Python developers often need to convert DOTX to EMLX format for various reasons. DOTX is a Microsoft Word template file format which is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is used to store text, images, formatting, macros, and other document elements. On the other hand, EMLX is an email message file format used by Apple Mail. It is used to store email messages in a plain text format. Converting DOTX to EMLX allows users to access the content of the DOTX file in Apple Mail.
