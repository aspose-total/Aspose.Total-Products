<h2>Why to Convert MD to VCF?</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a MD to VCF conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is used for formatting plain text documents into HTML. VCF (vCard) is a file format standard for electronic business cards. It is used for exchanging contact information between different software applications. Converting MD to VCF allows users to store contact information in a standard format, which can be easily shared and imported into other applications.
