<h2>Why to Convert EMLX to EMF?</h2>

EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail, while EMF is a vector graphics format used by Microsoft Windows. Converting EMLX to EMF allows users to view emails in a more versatile format, as EMF can be opened in a variety of applications. This makes it easier to share emails with others, as the EMF format is more widely supported than EMLX.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMLX to EMF Conversion?</h2>

- Open the source EMLX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMLX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMLX is converted

- For EMLX to EMF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
