Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting MBOX to DOCX. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, both of which are necessary for the conversion. The process is relatively simple and involves two steps. Firstly, the MBOX file needs to be loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the HTML needs to be loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective DOCX format. This process is made easy with the help of Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for dealing with different formats, including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats.

- Open the source MBOX file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MBOX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MBOX is converted
