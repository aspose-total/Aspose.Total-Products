<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster graphics image format used for storing high-quality images. It is widely used in the printing, publishing, and other industries. On the other hand, EML (Electronic Mail) is a file format used for storing emails. It is widely used for archiving emails and for transferring emails between different email clients. Therefore, it is necessary to convert TIFF to EML in order to store the images in an email format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For TIFF to EML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
