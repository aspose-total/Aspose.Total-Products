<h2>Why to Convert DOTX to PST?</h2>

The DOTX file format is a Microsoft Word template file that is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is used to store text, images, and other elements that can be used to create a document. However, the DOTX format is not compatible with the PST format, which is used to store emails and other data in Microsoft Outlook. Therefore, in order to use the DOTX file in Outlook, it must be converted to the PST format.
