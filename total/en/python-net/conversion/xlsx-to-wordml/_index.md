<h2>Why to Convert XLSX to WORDML</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert XLSX to WORDML arises when they want to add a feature within their application that allows users to convert XLSX files to WORDML format. This is because WORDML is a Microsoft Word format that is widely used for creating documents and is supported by many applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XLSX to WORDML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API is a full package of various APIs that can help automate the conversion process from XLSX to WORDML. It is mainly a two-step process. Firstly, the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API is used to convert the XLSX file to HTML. After that, the Word Python API, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, is used to save the created HTML into the desired Microsoft Word format. This API also provides various features such as document manipulation, mail merge, and document conversion. It also supports a wide range of file formats, including XLSX and WORDML.

- **Step 1** Open the source XLSX file using Workbook class
- Save XLSX file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output WORDML file path. So your XLSX file is converted to WORDML at the specified path
