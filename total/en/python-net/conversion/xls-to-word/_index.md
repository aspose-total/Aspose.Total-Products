<h2>Why to Convert XLS to Word</h2>

Converting XLS to Word is a common requirement for many Python developers. XLS files are widely used for storing tabular data and are supported by many applications. However, Word documents are more suitable for sharing and editing text documents. Therefore, converting XLS to Word is a great way to make the data more accessible and easier to share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XLS to Word Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats, including XLS and Word documents. The conversion process is done in two steps. 

Firstly, the XLS file is converted to HTML using the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API. This API provides a wide range of features for working with XLS files, including the ability to convert them to HTML. 

Once the XLS file has been converted to HTML, the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API can be used to save the HTML into the desired Microsoft Word format. This API provides a wide range of features for working with Word documents, including the ability to save HTML into Word documents. 

By using Aspose.Total for Python via .NET, developers can easily automate the process of converting XLS to Word documents. This can save time and effort, and make the data more accessible and easier to share.

- **Step 1** Open the source XLS file using Workbook class
- Save XLS file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output WORD file path. So your XLS file is converted to WORD at the specified path

- For XLS to WORD conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/) and [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-cells-python``` and ```pip install aspose.words```
