<h2>Why to Convert OFT to XPS</h2>

The Open Financial Transaction (OFT) format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Money to store financial data. It is a binary file format that is not easily readable by other applications. XPS (XML Paper Specification) is an open standard for document exchange that is supported by many applications. Converting OFT to XPS allows users to access their financial data in a more widely supported format.
