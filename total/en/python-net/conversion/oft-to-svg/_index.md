<h2>Why to Convert OFT to SVG?</h2>

The OFT format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages. It is not supported by other email clients or web browsers, so it is necessary to convert OFT files to a more widely supported format such as SVG. SVG is an open standard vector graphics format that is supported by most web browsers and email clients. Converting OFT to SVG allows the email message to be viewed on any device or platform.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OFT to SVG Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It provides a two-step process for converting OFT to SVG. Firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word SVG format. This makes the conversion process easy and automated using Python.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OFT to SVG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
