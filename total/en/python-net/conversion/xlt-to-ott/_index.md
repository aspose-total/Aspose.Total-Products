<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert XLT files to OTT format for various reasons. XLT files are used to store spreadsheet data and are widely used in the industry. OTT files are used to store text documents and are also widely used. Converting XLT files to OTT format allows developers to access the data stored in the XLT file in a text document format. This makes it easier to manipulate the data and use it in various applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XLT to OTT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API is a comprehensive package of various APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from XLT to OTT. It includes Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API and Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API. 

The first step in the conversion process is to use Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API to convert the XLT file to HTML. This API allows developers to easily convert XLT files to HTML with just a few lines of code. Once the XLT file is converted to HTML, the next step is to use Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API to save the HTML file into the desired Microsoft Word format. This API allows developers to easily save HTML files into OTT format with just a few lines of code.

- **Step 1** Open the source XLT file using Workbook class
- Save XLT file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output OTT file path. So your XLT file is converted to OTT at the specified path
