- Open the source MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Loop through each page and select one by one
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path with relevant image format as parameter. So your MHTML file is converted to required image at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MHTML to Images conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
