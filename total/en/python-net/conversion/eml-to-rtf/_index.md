<h2>Why to Convert EML to RTF</h2>

EML is a popular email format used by many email clients. It is a plain text file that contains the email message and its attachments. It is widely used for archiving emails and for transferring emails between different email clients. However, it is not suitable for editing or formatting emails. RTF (Rich Text Format) is a popular document format that is used for creating and exchanging documents between different applications. It is a text-based format that supports formatting, images, tables, and other objects. Therefore, it is a better choice for editing and formatting emails.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted
