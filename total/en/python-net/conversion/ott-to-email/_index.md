<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Python developers often need to convert OTT (Open Text Template) files to EMAIL format. This is because OTT files are not supported by most email clients, and thus need to be converted to a more compatible format. This conversion process can be automated using the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OTT to Email Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing with different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs, which makes the conversion of OTT to EMAIL format easy using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into EMAIL format. This process is automated and can be done quickly and easily using the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API.

- Open the source OTT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OTT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OTT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OTT to EMAIL conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
