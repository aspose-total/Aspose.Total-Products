<h2>Why to Convert OFT to RTF?</h2>

The Rich Text Format (RTF) is a file format that enables the exchange of text between different word processors and text-processing applications. It is a widely accepted format for exchanging text documents between different applications. RTF is a text-based format, which means that it is not dependent on the application used to create the document. This makes it an ideal format for exchanging documents between different applications.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted
