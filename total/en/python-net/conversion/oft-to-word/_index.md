<h2>Why to Convert OFT to Word?</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OFT to WORD conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why it is necessary to convert OFT to Word. OFT stands for Outlook Form Template and is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OFT to Word in order to make the content of the email message accessible to other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for oft to word conversion?</h2>

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted
