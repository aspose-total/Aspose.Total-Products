<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert OST to PS format arises when a Python developer is trying to add a feature within an application. OST is an Outlook data file that stores emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other Outlook items. PS is a PostScript file format that is used to store documents in a printer-friendly format. It is a popular format for printing documents, and is also used for creating documents that can be viewed on the web. Converting OST to PS format allows the user to view the documents in a printer-friendly format, and also makes it easier to share the documents with others.
