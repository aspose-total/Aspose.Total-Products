Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting ICS to IMAGE format within an application. It includes APIs for dealing with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Email needs to be loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the converted HTML needs to be loaded using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API and saved into the respective Word IMAGE format. This API package makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers. It is a reliable and secure solution that can be used to quickly and easily convert ICS to IMAGE format.

- Open the source ICS file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ICS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ICS is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ICS to IMAGE conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
