For a Python developer, who is trying to add a XLSX to PPTX conversion feature within application, [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including XLSX and PPTX files.

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/) API to convert XLSX file to PDF. After that by using PowerPoint Python API [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/), save the created PDF into desired Microsoft PowerPoint format.
