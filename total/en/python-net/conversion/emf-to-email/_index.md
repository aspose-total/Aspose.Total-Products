<h2>Why to Convert EMF to Email?</h2>

EMF (Enhanced Metafile) is a vector graphics format used to store images and other graphical objects. It is widely used in Windows operating systems and is supported by many applications. Email is a popular communication medium used to send messages, documents, images, and other files. Converting EMF to Email format is necessary to send EMF files as attachments in emails.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMF to Email Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that helps developers to automate the conversion process of EMF to Email. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that makes the conversion easy. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into EMAIL format. This process is simple and efficient and can be easily integrated into any application.

- Open the source EMF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMF to EMAIL conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
