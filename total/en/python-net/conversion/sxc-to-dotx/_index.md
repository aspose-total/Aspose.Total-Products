<h2>Why to Convert SXC to DOTX?</h2>

The SXC file format is a spreadsheet format used by the OpenOffice Calc application. It is a popular format for storing and sharing data. However, it is not compatible with Microsoft Word, which uses the DOTX format. Therefore, if a user wants to view or edit the data stored in an SXC file in Microsoft Word, they must first convert it to the DOTX format.

- **Step 1** Open the source SXC file using Workbook class
- Save SXC file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output DOTX file path. So your SXC file is converted to DOTX at the specified path
