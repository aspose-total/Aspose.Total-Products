<h2>Why to Convert DOTX to OST?</h2>

For a Python developer, the need to convert DOTX to OST arises when they are trying to add a feature within their application that requires the conversion of DOTX files to OST format. DOTX is a Microsoft Word template file format that is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. OST, on the other hand, is an offline storage table file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, and other Outlook items. Converting DOTX to OST allows the user to access the contents of the DOTX file in Outlook.
