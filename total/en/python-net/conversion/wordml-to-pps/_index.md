For a Python developer, who is trying to add a WORDML to PPS conversion feature within application? [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats. 

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) API to convert WORDML file to PDF. After that by using PowerPoint Python API [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/), save the created PDF into Presentation as a PPS format.

- **Step 1** Open the source WORDML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
	- Save WORDML file to PDF by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/save/) method by providing the file name and desired directory path.
-  **Step 2** Load PDF file with an instance of [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class
	-  Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat.PPS as parameters. So your WORDML file is converted to PPS at the specified path.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For WORDML to PPS conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Slides](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Slides/) and [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.slides``` and ```pip install aspose.words```.
-  Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Slides](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow [step by step instructions](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/).
