For a Python developer, who is trying to add a OST to OST conversion feature within application? [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs that are part of [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package makes this conversion easy using Python. It's a two step process, firstly load the Word file and render it into HTML via [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/). Secondly load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) and save it into OST format.

- Open the source OST file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OST file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OST is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OST to OST conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
