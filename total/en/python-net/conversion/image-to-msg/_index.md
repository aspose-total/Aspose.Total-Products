<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting an image to a MSG file is a useful way to store and share the image in a format that is compatible with a variety of email clients. It also allows for the image to be easily edited and manipulated.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Image to MSG Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help developers automate the conversion process from image to MSG. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make it easy to convert an image to a MSG file using Python. The process involves two steps: first, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, and then the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into MSG format. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert images to MSG files.

- Open the source IMAGE file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your IMAGE file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the IMAGE is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For IMAGE to MSG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
