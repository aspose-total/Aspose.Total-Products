<h2>Why to Convert PST to GIF?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its ability to preserve the formatting of the original document. However, the PDF format is not suitable for all applications. For example, if you need to create an image from a PDF document, you will need to convert it to a GIF format. GIF is a popular image format that is used for web graphics and other applications. Converting a PDF document to a GIF image allows you to create an image that can be used in web pages, emails, and other applications.
