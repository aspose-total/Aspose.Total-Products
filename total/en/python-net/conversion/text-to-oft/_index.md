Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is an API package that provides a comprehensive solution for developers who are looking to add a TEXT to OFT conversion feature within their application. It includes various APIs that deal with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. The conversion process is made easy with the help of two APIs that are part of the package, namely Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. 
The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into OFT format. This process is automated and can be easily implemented with the help of the APIs. The APIs are easy to use and provide a reliable solution for developers who are looking to add a TEXT to OFT conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source TEXT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your TEXT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the TEXT is converted

- For TEXT to OFT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
