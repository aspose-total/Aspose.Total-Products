Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting a PNG to OST format within an application. It contains APIs for dealing with different formats such as Email, Images and Microsoft Word. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into the OST format. This API package makes the conversion process easy and efficient for Python developers.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your PNG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the PNG is converted

- For PNG to OST conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
