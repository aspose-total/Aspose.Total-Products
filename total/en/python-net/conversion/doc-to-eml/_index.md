Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting a DOC file to an EML file. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which make it easy to perform the conversion. The process involves two steps. First, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Then, the HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved as an EML file. This API package is a great tool for developers who need to quickly and easily convert DOC files to EML files. It is reliable, efficient, and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for developers who need to quickly and easily convert DOC files to EML files.

- Open the source DOC file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOC file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOC is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOC to EML conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
