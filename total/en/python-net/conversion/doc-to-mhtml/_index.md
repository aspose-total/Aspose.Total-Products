As a Python developer, you may need to add a feature to your application that allows you to convert DOC files to MHTML (Web archive format) or HtmlFixed, which saves the document in the HTML format using absolutely positioned elements. Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API can help you automate this process. This package includes various APIs that can help you with different file formats. 

Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API, which is part of the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET package, can be used to add the DOC to MHTML conversion feature. If the DOC file is simple, it only requires two lines of code: loading the DOC file and calling the save method with the appropriate file path and SaveFormat enumeration (MHTML or HTML_FIXED). However, if you need to restore the document model as close to the original as possible, you will need to save extra information within the resultant document, known as round-trip information.

- Load source DOC file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Create the instance of [HtmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/)
- Set the export_roundtrip_information as True
- Specify the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/saveformat/) as MHTML
- Call the `save` method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat as parameters. So your DOC file is converted to MHTML at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOC to MHTML or HtmlFixed format conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
- Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose.words```
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
