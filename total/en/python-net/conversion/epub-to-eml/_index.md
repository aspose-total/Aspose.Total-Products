<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to EML?</h2>

EPUB is a popular format for e-books, which is used by many publishers and readers. It is an open standard format for digital books, which is based on XML and HTML. EML is a file format used by many email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Apple Mail. It is a plain text file that contains the email message, including the sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachments. Converting EPUB to EML allows users to view the content of the e-book in their email client.
