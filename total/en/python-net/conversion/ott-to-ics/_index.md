<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting OTT (Outlook Template) to ICS (iCalendar) format is important for a Python developer who is trying to add a feature within an application. ICS is a standard format for calendar data exchange and is supported by many calendar applications. It is a text-based format and is used to store calendar information such as events, to-dos, and journal entries. OTT is a Microsoft Outlook template format which is used to store Outlook messages, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other Outlook items. It is not supported by other calendar applications, so it needs to be converted to ICS format.
