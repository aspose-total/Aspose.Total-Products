<h2>Why to Convert OTT to EMLX?</h2>

OTT (Open Text Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a binary file format that stores the document in a compressed form. It is used to store documents in a smaller size and is used to store documents in a secure manner. EMLX is an email file format used by Apple Mail. It is an XML-based file format that stores emails in a structured format. It is used to store emails in a secure manner and is also used to store emails in a smaller size. Therefore, it is necessary to convert OTT to EMLX in order to store emails in a secure and smaller size.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for OTT to EMLX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It helps to automate the conversion process from OTT to EMLX. It consists of two APIs, Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion process easy using Python. The conversion process is a two step process. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into EMLX format. This makes the conversion process from OTT to EMLX easier and faster.

- Open the source OTT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OTT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OTT is converted
