Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of adding a MSG to MD conversion feature to their application. It includes the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" and "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" APIs, which make the conversion process easy and straightforward. The process involves two steps: firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API, and then the HTML is loaded using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API and saved into the respective Word MD format. This package of APIs provides a reliable and efficient way to convert MSG files to MD format, allowing developers to quickly and easily add this feature to their applications.

- Open the source MSG file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MSG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MSG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For MSG to MD conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
