<h2>Why to Convert ODS to RTF</h2>

Python developers often need to convert ODS files to RTF format for various reasons. ODS files are used to store spreadsheets, while RTF is a document format that is supported by many word processors. Converting ODS to RTF allows users to open and edit the spreadsheet data in a word processor, making it easier to share and collaborate on the data.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for ODS to RTF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help automate the conversion process from ODS to RTF. It includes APIs for dealing with different file formats, including ODS and RTF files. The conversion process is done in two steps. 

The first step is to use the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API to convert the ODS file to HTML. This API provides a range of features for working with spreadsheets, including the ability to convert them to HTML. 

The second step is to use the Aspose.Words for Python via .NET API to save the created HTML into the desired Microsoft Word format. This API provides a range of features for working with documents, including the ability to save HTML into Word documents. 

By using the Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API, developers can quickly and easily convert ODS files to RTF format. This makes it easier to share and collaborate on spreadsheet data, as well as open and edit it in a word processor.

- **Step 1** Open the source ODS file using Workbook class
- Save ODS file to HTML by using save(file, SaveFormat.HTML) method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load HTML file with an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
-  Call the `save` method while specifying output RTF file path. So your ODS file is converted to RTF at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For ODS to RTF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/) and [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-cells-python``` and ```pip install aspose.words```
-  Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Cells](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/python-net/getting-started/#installation) and [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow [step by step instructions](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
