Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer to automate the process of converting EMF to MSG. It includes two APIs, namely Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET, which makes the conversion process easy. The conversion process involves two steps. Firstly, the Word file is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into MSG format. The APIs provide a wide range of features that can be used to customize the conversion process. For example, the user can set the desired output format, specify the desired font, and set the desired page size. Additionally, the APIs also provide support for various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. Furthermore, the APIs also provide support for various other features such as encryption, digital signatures, and watermarking. Thus, Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is an ideal solution for a Python developer who is looking to add a EMF to MSG conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source EMF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMF file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMF is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EMF to MSG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
