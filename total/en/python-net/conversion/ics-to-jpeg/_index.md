<h2>Why to Convert ICS to JPEG?</h2>

ICS (iCalendar) is a popular file format used to store calendar information, such as events, meetings, and tasks. It is widely used by many applications, such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar. However, ICS files are not supported by many applications, such as Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word. Therefore, it is necessary to convert ICS files to JPEG format in order to use them in these applications.

- Open the source ICS file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your ICS file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the ICS is converted
