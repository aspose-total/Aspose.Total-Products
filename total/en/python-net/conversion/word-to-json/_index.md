To convert Word files to JSON using Python, you will need to have Python 3.5 or a later version installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need to reference the necessary APIs within your project. Two popular options for this are [Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/), which can be installed via pip using the following commands:<br>
```pip install aspose.words```<br>
```pip install aspose-cells-python```<br>
Please note that if you are using Linux as your operating system, you may need to install additional requirements such as gcc and libpython.
