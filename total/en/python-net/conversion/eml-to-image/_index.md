As a Python developer, if you are looking to add a feature to convert EML to IMAGE within your application, then [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help you automate the process. This package contains various APIs that can help you deal with different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/) APIs are part of the [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) package and can be used to convert EML to IMAGE in two steps. Firstly, you need to load the Email and render it into HTML using [Aspose.Email for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/python-net/). Secondly, you need to load the converted HTML using [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/python-net/) and save it into the respective Word IMAGE format. This API is easy to use and can help you save time and effort in the conversion process. It also ensures that the output is of high quality and accuracy.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to IMAGE conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
