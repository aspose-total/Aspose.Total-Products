<h2>Why to Convert WordML to EML?</h2>

WordML is an XML-based format used to store Microsoft Word documents. It is an open standard format that is used to store documents in a structured manner. EML is an email message format used by many email clients and services. It is a text-based format that stores the message in plain text, including the headers, body, and attachments.
