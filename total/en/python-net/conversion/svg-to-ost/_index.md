<h2>Why to Convert SVG to OST</h2>

For a Python developer, who is trying to add a SVG to OST conversion feature within application, it is important to understand why this conversion is necessary. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and is a type of vector image format. It is used to create and store images in XML format. OST stands for Offline Storage Table and is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. OST files are used to store data in an offline mode, which means that the data is stored on the local computer and not on the server. Therefore, it is important to convert SVG to OST in order to make the data available offline.
