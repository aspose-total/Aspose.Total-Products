<h2>Why to Convert Email to BMP</h2>

Email to BMP conversion is a useful process for Python developers who are looking to add a feature to their application. BMP is a popular image format that is widely used for various purposes. It is a lossless format that can store images with high quality and resolution. Converting emails to BMP can help to store emails in a more organized manner and make them easier to access and share.

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help to automate the conversion process. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that make the conversion process easy. The two-step process involves loading the email using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and rendering it into HTML. The HTML can then be loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word BMP format. This process is simple and efficient and can help to save time and effort.

- Open the source EMAIL file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EMAIL file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EMAIL is converted

- For EMAIL to BMP conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
