<h2>Why to Convert DOCX to EMLX?</h2>

Python developers often need to convert DOCX files to EMLX format for various reasons. EMLX is a file format used by Apple Mail to store emails. It is a plain text file with an .emlx extension and contains the email message in MIME format. It is used to store emails in a single file, which makes it easier to transfer and store emails.

- Open the source DOCX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOCX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOCX is converted
