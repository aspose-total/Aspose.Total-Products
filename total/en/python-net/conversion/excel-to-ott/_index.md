<h2>Why to Convert Excel to OTT</h2>

Excel is a popular spreadsheet application used to store and manage data. It is widely used in various industries for data analysis, reporting, and other data-related tasks. However, Excel files are not compatible with other applications, such as OpenOffice, which uses the OpenDocument Text (OTT) format. Therefore, it is necessary to convert Excel files to OTT format in order to use them in other applications.
