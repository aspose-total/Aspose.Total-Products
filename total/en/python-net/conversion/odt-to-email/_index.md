<h2>Why to Convert ODT to Email</h2>

Open Document Text (ODT) is a file format used to store documents such as text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, and databases. It is an open standard for document exchange and is used by many applications, including OpenOffice, LibreOffice, and Apache OpenOffice. Email is a widely used communication medium for exchanging messages between two or more people. Email messages are typically composed of plain text, HTML, or a combination of both.
