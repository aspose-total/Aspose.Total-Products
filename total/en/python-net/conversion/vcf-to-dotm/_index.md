<h2>Why to Convert VCF to DOTM?</h2>

VCF (Virtual Contact File) is a file format used to store contact information such as name, address, phone number, email address, etc. It is widely used by many email clients and contact management applications. DOTM (Document Template) is a Microsoft Word file format used to store document templates. It is used to create documents with predefined formatting and layout. Converting VCF to DOTM allows users to store contact information in a format that can be easily accessed and edited in Microsoft Word.
