<h2>Why to Convert OFT to ODT?</h2>

The OpenDocument Text (ODT) format is an open standard for word processing documents, such as those created by Microsoft Word. It is based on the XML format and is used by many applications, including OpenOffice and LibreOffice. On the other hand, the Outlook Form Template (OFT) format is a proprietary format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email templates. It is not compatible with other applications, so it is necessary to convert OFT files to ODT in order to use them in other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OFT to ODT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that make it easy to automate the conversion process from OFT to ODT using Python. It is a two step process, firstly load Email and render it into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly load the converted HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and save it into respective Word ODT format. This makes it easy for Python developers to add a OFT to ODT conversion feature within their application.

- Open the source OFT file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your OFT file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the OFT is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For OFT to ODT conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
