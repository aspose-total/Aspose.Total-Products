For a Python developer, who is trying to add a XLS to PPSX conversion feature within application, [Aspose.Total for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/python-net/) API can help to automate the conversion process. It's a full package of various APIs dealing different formats including XLS and PPSX files.

It's mainly in two steps. Firstly use [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-net/) API to convert XLS file to PDF. After that by using PowerPoint Python API [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/), save the created PDF into desired Microsoft PowerPoint format.

- **Step 1** Use Workbook class instance to open the source XLS file 
- Save XLS file to PDF by using save method by providing the file name and desired directory path
-  **Step 2** Load PDF file using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class
-  Call the [save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) method while specifying output PPSX file path. So your XLS file is converted to PPSX at the specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For XLS to PPSX conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Cells](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells-python/) and [Aspose.Slides](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Slides/))
-  Or use the following pip commands ```pip install aspose-cells-python``` and ```pip install aspose.slides```
-  Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Cells](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/python-net/getting-started/#installation) and [Slides](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/python-net/system-requirements/))
