Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" API is a comprehensive package of various APIs that can help a Python developer to automate the process of converting a Word document into a MSG file. It includes two APIs, namely Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word document is loaded and rendered into HTML using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Email for Python via .NET and saved into MSG format.
The Aspose.Total for Python via .NET API is a powerful tool that can help developers to quickly and easily convert Word documents into MSG files. It is easy to use and provides a reliable and efficient way to automate the conversion process. Furthermore, the API is highly customizable and can be used to customize the conversion process according to the specific requirements of the application.

- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your WORD file is converted to HTML at the specified path

- For WORD to MSG conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
