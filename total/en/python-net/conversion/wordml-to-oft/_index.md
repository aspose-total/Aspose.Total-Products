<h2>Why to Convert WordML to OFT?</h2>

WordML is an XML-based format used to store Microsoft Word documents. It is an open standard format that is used to store and exchange documents. OFT is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store email messages, contacts, tasks, and other items. It is a proprietary format and is not supported by other email clients. Therefore, it is necessary to convert WordML to OFT in order to make the documents compatible with Microsoft Outlook.
