<h2>Why to Convert MD to MSG?</h2>

The MD (Markdown) format is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents. It is commonly used for writing and formatting text for webpages, blogs, and other online content. On the other hand, MSG (Outlook Message Format) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook and Exchange to store emails, contacts, tasks, calendar items, and other data. Converting MD to MSG is necessary for those who need to access their MD documents in Outlook or Exchange.

- Open the source MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your MD file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the MD is converted
