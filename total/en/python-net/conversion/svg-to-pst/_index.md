<h2>Why to Convert SVG to PST?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is supported by most operating systems. However, the PDF format is not suitable for all applications. For example, if you need to edit a document, the PDF format is not suitable. In such cases, it is necessary to convert the PDF file to a different format, such as PST.
