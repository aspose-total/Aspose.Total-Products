Aspose.Total for Python via .NET" is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help a Python developer automate the process of converting a SVG to EMAIL. This package includes APIs for dealing with Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Word file needs to be loaded and rendered into HTML using the "Aspose.Words for Python via .NET" API. Secondly, the converted HTML needs to be loaded using the "Aspose.Email for Python via .NET" API and saved into an EMAIL format. This process is made easy with the help of the APIs provided by "Aspose.Total for Python via .NET". The APIs are designed to make the conversion process simple and efficient, allowing the developer to focus on other aspects of the application.

- Open the source SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your SVG file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the SVG is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For SVG to EMAIL conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
