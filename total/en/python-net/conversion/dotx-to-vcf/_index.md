<h2>Why to Convert DOTX to VCF?</h2>

The DOTX file format is a Microsoft Word template file that is used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is a great way to ensure that all documents created with the same template have the same formatting and layout. However, the DOTX file format is not compatible with many other applications, including contact management applications. This is where the VCF file format comes in. VCF, or vCard, is a file format used to store contact information, such as name, address, phone number, and email address. Converting a DOTX file to a VCF file allows the contact information stored in the DOTX file to be used in other applications.

- Open the source DOTX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/) class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your DOTX file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using MailMessage.load
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the DOTX is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For DOTX to VCF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
