<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The need to convert EML to EMF arises when a Python developer is trying to add a feature within an application that requires the conversion of an email message to an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format. EMF is a vector graphics format that is used to store images and other graphical objects. It is a popular format for storing and displaying images and is supported by a wide range of applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EML to EMF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for Python via .NET is a full package of various APIs dealing with different formats including Email, Images and Microsoft Word formats. It includes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and Aspose.Email for Python via .NET APIs that make the conversion of EML to EMF easy using Python. The conversion process is a two-step process. Firstly, the Email is loaded and rendered into HTML via Aspose.Email for Python via .NET. Secondly, the converted HTML is loaded using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET and saved into the respective Word EMF format. This process is automated and makes the conversion of EML to EMF easy and efficient.

- Open the source EML file using MailMessage.load class
- Call the `save` method while specifying output HTML file path and relevant HTML Save options as parameter. So your EML file is converted to HTML at the specified path
- Now Load the saved HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/)
- Call the save method with relevant file path. So finally the EML is converted

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Conversion Requirements" %}}

- For EML to EMF conversion, Python 3.5 or later is required
- Reference APIs within the project directly from PyPI ([Aspose.Words](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/) and [Aspose.Email](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET/))
- Or use the following pip command ```pip install aspose.words``` and ```pip install Aspose.Email-for-Python-via-NET``` 
- Moreover, Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS (see more for [Words](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/system-requirements/) and [Email](https://docs.aspose.com/email/python-net/system-requirements/)) and for Linux check additional requirements for gcc and libpython and follow step by step instructions [INSTALL](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/installation/)
