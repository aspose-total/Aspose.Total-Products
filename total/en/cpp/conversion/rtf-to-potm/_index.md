<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
RTF (Rich Text Format) is a document file format used by Microsoft Word and other word processing applications. It is a popular format for exchanging documents between different applications. POTM (PowerPoint Open XML Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations that contain macros. Converting RTF to POTM allows users to take advantage of the features and functionality of PowerPoint, such as the ability to add animations, transitions, and other effects.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for rtf to potm conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for C++ is a powerful file automation API that allows users to automate the conversion of RTF to POTM. It consists of two APIs: Aspose.Words for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.Words for C++ can be used to load an RTF document and convert it to HTML. Aspose.Slides for C++ can then be used to load the HTML and create a new presentation, which can then be saved as a POTM file. This process allows users to quickly and easily convert RTF documents to POTM files, making it easier to take advantage of the features and functionality of PowerPoint.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Load Password Protected RTF Document via C++" %}}
Apart from document conversion, [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API allows tons of document manipulation features for C++ developers. In case your Microsoft Word RTF file format is password protected, you can still open it using the API. In order to load the encrypted document, you can use a special constructor overload, which accepts a [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.loading.load_options) object. This object contains the Password property, which specifies the password string.  
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// when loading password protected document, the password is passed to the document's constructor using a LoadOptions object.
auto options = MakeObject<LoadOptions>(u"docPassword");
// load the document from the local file system by filename:
SharedPtr<Document> doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"Encrypted.rtf", options);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Comments in POTM Document via C++" %}}
While saving RTF as POTM, you can also use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to add further features in your POTM document. For instance, you can add comments in your presentation. The presentation slide comment are associated with a particular author. The Presentation class holds the collection of authors in ICommentAuthorCollection that are responsible for adding slide comments. For each author, there is a collection of comments in ICommentCollection.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate Presentation class
SharedPtr<Presentation>pres = MakeObject<Presentation>();
// access first slide
SharedPtr<ILayoutSlide>layout = pres->get_LayoutSlides()->idx_get(0);
// add empty slide
pres->get_Slides()->AddEmptySlide(layout);
// adding Author
SharedPtr<ICommentAuthor> author = pres->get_CommentAuthors()->AddAuthor(u"John Doe", u"MF");
// set position of comments
System::Drawing::PointF point = System::Drawing::PointF(0.2f, 0.2f);
// add slide comment for an author on slide 1
author->get_Comments()->AddComment(u"Hello John, this is a slide comment", pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(1), point, DateTime::get_Now());
// access ISlide 1
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// save presentation as Potm
pres->Save(output.potm, Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Potm);
