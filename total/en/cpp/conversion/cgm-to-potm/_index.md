<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate CGM to POTM conversion feature inside your C++ applications. CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format, while POTM (PowerPoint Open XML Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a presentation format. Converting from CGM to POTM is necessary to make sure that the presentation is compatible with the latest version of Microsoft PowerPoint.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to POTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help you to export CGM to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POTM. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.PDF for C++ allows you to export CGM to PPTX, while Aspose.Slides for C++ helps you to convert PPTX to POTM. Both APIs are easy to use and can be integrated into your C++ applications with minimal effort. Moreover, Aspose.Total for C++ also offers a wide range of other features such as document manipulation, text extraction, image processing, and more.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert CGM to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load CGM file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.cgm");
// save CGM as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Potm format
prs->Save(u"output.potm", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Potm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of CGM Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering CGM to POTM, you can open a password protected CGM and also change its password. In order to change the password of a CGM file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing CGM Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.cgm", L"owner");
// change password of CGM Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTM File via C++" %}}
After converting CGM to POTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potm", SaveFormat::Potm);
