<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting PDF to WordML is a common requirement for many C++ developers. WordML is an XML-based format used to represent Word documents. It is an open standard that allows documents to be easily shared and edited across different platforms. WordML documents are also easier to search and index, making them ideal for archiving and data analysis.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PDF Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PDF to WORDML, you can open a password protected PDF and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PDF file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PDF Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pdf", L"owner");
// change password of PDF Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict WORDML File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict WORDML file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.WordML");  
```
