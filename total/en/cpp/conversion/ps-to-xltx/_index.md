<h2>Why to Convert PS to XLTX in C++?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its compatibility across different platforms and devices. However, PDF files are not suitable for editing or manipulating data. This is where the XLSX and XLTX formats come in. XLSX and XLTX are Microsoft Excel formats that are designed for data manipulation and analysis. Converting PDF files to XLSX and XLTX formats allows users to edit and manipulate the data in the documents.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PS document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PS file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
