<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to XLSB</h2>
MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format that combines resources such as images, audio, and video into a single file. It is used to save webpages for offline viewing and is supported by most web browsers. XLSB (Excel Binary) is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel. It is a faster and more efficient file format than the XLSX format and is used to store large spreadsheets. Converting MHTML to XLSB can help to reduce the size of the file and make it easier to share and store.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to XLSB Conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to convert MHTML to XLSB in C++. It consists of three components: Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Words for C++. The process of converting MHTML to XLSB is a simple two-step process. In the first step, you can export MHTML to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. After that, by using Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to XLSB. Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy to convert MHTML to XLSB in C++ with just a few lines of code. It also provides a wide range of features such as support for various file formats, the ability to manipulate documents, and the ability to create and edit spreadsheets.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set MHTML File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MHTML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MHTML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XLSB File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving XLSB file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
