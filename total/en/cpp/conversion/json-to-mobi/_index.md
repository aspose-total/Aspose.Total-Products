<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format and is easy for humans to read and write. MOBI is a popular ebook format developed by Amazon for the Kindle. It is used to store ebooks and other digital publications. Converting JSON to MOBI allows users to read their JSON data on Kindle devices.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for json to mobi conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables developers to work with a wide range of file formats within their C++ applications. It includes Aspose.Cells for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to convert JSON to MOBI. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can parse JSON to MOBI in two simple steps. Firstly, Aspose.Cells for C++ can be used to export JSON to PDF. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ can be used to convert PDF to MOBI. This makes it easy for developers to convert JSON to MOBI within their C++ applications. 

Aspose.Cells for C++ is a powerful spreadsheet processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert and render spreadsheets within their C++ applications. It supports a wide range of file formats, including PDF, XLSX, XLS, ODS, CSV, HTML, MHTML, TXT and many more. It also supports exporting JSON to PDF, which makes it ideal for converting JSON to MOBI.

Aspose.Words for C++ is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert and render documents within their C++ applications. It supports a wide range of file formats, including DOCX, DOC, ODT, RTF, HTML, MHTML, TXT and many more. It also supports converting PDF to MOBI, which makes it ideal for converting JSON to MOBI.

Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy for developers to parse JSON to MOBI within their C++ applications. It includes Aspose.Cells for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to export JSON to PDF and convert PDF to MOBI respectively. This makes it easy for developers to convert JSON to MOBI within their C++ applications.

While parsing JSON to MOBI, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to MOBI with Watermark in C++" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to MOBI with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your MOBI document, you can first convert JSON to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class, set different properties for text watermark,
call SetText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to MOBI.
