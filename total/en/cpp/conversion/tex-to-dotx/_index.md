<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TEX is a popular file format used for creating documents, especially in the academic and scientific fields. It is a plain text format that is easy to read and write, but it is not suitable for use in other applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert TEX files to other formats such as DOC and DOTX.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to DOTX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert TEX to DOTX in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert TEX file format to DOC. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to DOTX. 

Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful PDF manipulation library that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their C++ applications. It supports a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, image extraction, and more. Aspose.Words for C++ is a powerful Word document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert Word documents from within their C++ applications. It supports a wide range of features such as document conversion, text extraction, image extraction, and more.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily convert TEX to DOTX in two simple steps. Firstly, they can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert TEX file format to DOC. Secondly, they can use Aspose.Words for C++ to export DOC to DOTX. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert TEX files to other formats such as DOC and DOTX.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert TEX to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to DOTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of TEX Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering TEX to DOTX, you can open a password protected TEX and also change its password. In order to change the password of a TEX file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing TEX Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.tex", L"owner");
// change password of TEX Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOTX File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict DOTX file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Dotx");  
```
