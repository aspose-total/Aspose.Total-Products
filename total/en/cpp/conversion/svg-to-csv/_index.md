Converting SVG to CSV in C++ via [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) file format automation libraries is a simple two step process. In the first step, you can export SVG to XLSX by using [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/), After that, by using [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/) Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to CSV.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to XLSX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a6383c010776212483f51cc41235924db) member function
3. Load XLSX document by using [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class reference
4. Save the document to CSV format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set SVG File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your SVG document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a SVG file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save CSV File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving CSV file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
