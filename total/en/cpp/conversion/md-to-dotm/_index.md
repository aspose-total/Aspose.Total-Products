<h2>Why to Convert MD to DOTM</h2>

The MD file format is a markdown language used to create documents. It is a plain text formatting syntax that is used to create web pages and other documents. The DOTM file format is a Microsoft Word template file used to store macros and other settings. It is used to create documents with the same formatting and layout. Converting MD to DOTM allows users to create documents with the same formatting and layout as the original MD document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to DOTM, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOTM File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict DOTM file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Dotm");  
```
