<h2>Why to Convert XPS to XLSB?</h2>

XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a document format developed by Microsoft that is used to store documents in a fixed layout. It is similar to PDF, but it is not as widely used. XLSB (Excel Binary File Format) is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel to store its documents. It is a more efficient format than XLSX, as it is much smaller in size and can be opened faster. Therefore, it is often preferred over XLSX for large spreadsheets. Converting XPS to XLSB can help to reduce the size of the document and make it easier to open and work with.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for XPS to XLSB Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to convert XPS to XLSB in C++. It consists of three components: Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Total for C++. The first step in the conversion process is to export XPS to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for C++. This library provides a set of APIs that can be used to read and write XPS documents. After that, Aspose.Cells for C++ can be used to convert XLSX to XLSB. This library provides a set of APIs that can be used to manipulate spreadsheets and convert them to different formats. With Aspose.Total for C++, the entire process of converting XPS to XLSB can be completed in just two steps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set XPS File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XPS document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XPS file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XLSB File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving XLSB file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
