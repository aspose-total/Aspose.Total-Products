<h2>Why to Convert PPTM to JSON?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular file format used for documents that require a high degree of accuracy and precision. It is widely used for business documents, legal documents, and other documents that need to be shared across different platforms. However, PDFs are not always the best choice for data storage and manipulation. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is becoming increasingly popular for data storage and manipulation. JSON is easier to read and write than PDF, and it is also more flexible and efficient.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
