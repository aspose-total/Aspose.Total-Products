<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer, you may need to integrate TEX to PPTM conversion feature inside your C++ applications. TEX is a document markup language and PPTM is a presentation file format. Converting TEX to PPTM will enable you to create presentations from TEX documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to PPTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a package that contains APIs for manipulating various file formats. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. You can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export TEX to PPTX and Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to PPTM.

To export TEX to PPTX, you can use the Aspose.PDF for C++ API. It provides a set of classes and functions to create, read, write, modify, and convert PDF documents. You can use the API to export TEX documents to PPTX format.

Once you have exported the TEX document to PPTX, you can use the Aspose.Slides for C++ API to convert PPTX to PPTM. Aspose.Slides for C++ is a powerful API for creating, reading, writing, and manipulating presentations. It provides a set of classes and functions to create, read, write, modify, and convert presentations. You can use the API to convert PPTX to PPTM format.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily integrate TEX to PPTM conversion feature inside your C++ applications. The package provides APIs for exporting TEX to PPTX and converting PPTX to PPTM. It is a convenient and cost-effective way to add TEX to PPTM conversion feature to your C++ applications.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pptm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of TEX Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering TEX to PPTM, you can open a password protected TEX and also change its password. In order to change the password of a TEX file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing TEX Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.tex", L"owner");
// change password of TEX Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPTM File via C++" %}}
After converting TEX to PPTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pptm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pptm", SaveFormat::Pptm);
