<h2>Why to Convert SVG to PPT?</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web graphics, and is also used in the printing industry. On the other hand, PPT (PowerPoint) is a popular presentation format used for creating slideshows. It is used to present information in a visually appealing way. Therefore, it is important to convert SVG to PPT in order to make the presentation more attractive and engaging.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to PPT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents in various formats. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, and Words. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate SVG to PPT conversion feature inside their C++ applications.

To export SVG to PPTX, developers can use Aspose.PDF for C++. It is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also supports conversion of SVG to PPTX.

To convert PPTX to PPT, developers can use Aspose.Slides for C++. It is a powerful presentation manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert presentations. It also supports conversion of PPTX to PPT.

Therefore, with Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate SVG to PPT conversion feature inside their C++ applications in just two simple steps.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to PPT, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPT File via C++" %}}
After converting SVG to PPT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppt");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppt", SaveFormat::Ppt);
