<h2>Why to Convert JSON to PPSM</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format and is easy for humans to read and write. PPSM (PowerPoint Slide Show Macro-Enabled) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to save presentations that contain macros. It is a binary file format and is used to store presentations with macros. Converting JSON to PPSM can be useful in many scenarios, such as when you need to store data in a presentation or when you need to share data with someone who uses PowerPoint.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to PPSM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that can be used to create, manipulate, and convert documents in various formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Cells for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to convert JSON to PPSM within any C++ application. 

Using Aspose.Cells for C++, you can parse JSON to PPTX. After that, Aspose.Slides for C++ can be used to convert PPTX to PPSM. Both APIs are available as part of the Aspose.Total for C++ package. The APIs are easy to use and can be integrated into any C++ application. They also provide a wide range of features that can be used to manipulate documents in various ways. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for C++ is a great solution for converting JSON to PPSM within any C++ application. It provides two APIs that can be used to parse JSON to PPTX and then convert PPTX to PPSM. The APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features that can be used to manipulate documents in various ways.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPSM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) method

While parsing JSON to PPSM, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PPSM with Watermark in C++" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPSM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPSM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class, get the first slide, Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type, add TextFrame to the Rectangle, create the Paragraph object for a text frame, create Portion object for paragraph, add watermark using set_Text() and, can save the document to PPSM.
