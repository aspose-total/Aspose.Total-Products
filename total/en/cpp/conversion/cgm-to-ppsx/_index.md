<h2>Why to Convert CGM to PPSX?</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. On the other hand, PPSX (PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show) is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is used to store slides in a presentation. Therefore, if you are a C++ developer and want to add a feature to integrate CGM to PPSX conversion inside your C++ applications, you need to convert CGM to PPSX.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for CGM to PPSX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of all the C++ APIs offered by Aspose. It includes APIs for manipulating and converting various file formats. To convert CGM to PPSX, you can use two APIs from Aspose.Total for C++ package. First, you can use [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) to export CGM to PPTX. Secondly, you can use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to convert PPTX to PPSX. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) package. Therefore, you can easily integrate CGM to PPSX conversion feature inside your C++ applications in two simple steps.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert CGM to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPSX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Ppsx` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load CGM file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.cgm");
// save CGM as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Ppsx format
prs->Save(u"output.ppsx", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Ppsx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of CGM Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering CGM to PPSX, you can open a password protected CGM and also change its password. In order to change the password of a CGM file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing CGM Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.cgm", L"owner");
// change password of CGM Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPSX File via C++" %}}
After converting CGM to PPSX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPSX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppsx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppsx", SaveFormat::Ppsx);
