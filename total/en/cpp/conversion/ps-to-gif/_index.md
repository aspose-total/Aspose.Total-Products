<h2>Why to Convert PS to GIF</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents, and is often used for archiving and printing. However, the PDF format is not suitable for web use, as it is not supported by all web browsers. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PDF documents to other formats, such as GIF, for web use.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to GIF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert PS to GIF in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert PS file format to DOC. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export DOC to GIF. This makes it easy for C++ developers to quickly and easily convert PS to GIF without having to manually convert the file. Furthermore, Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other features, such as the ability to create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents, as well as the ability to convert between various document formats.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PS to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to GIF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with C++ File Automation APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PS to GIF, you can open a password protected PS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.ps", L"owner");
// change password of PS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict GIF File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict GIF file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Gif");  
```
