<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

C++ developers often need to add email conversion features to their applications. This could be for a variety of reasons, such as to make the emails easier to read, or to make them more compatible with other applications. Converting OFT files to HTML is one way to do this.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OFT to FLATOPC Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help C++ developers with their email conversion needs. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert OFT files to HTML and then export HTML to FLATOPC. The first API is Aspose.Email for C++, which can be used to convert OFT files to HTML. The second API is Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to export HTML to FLATOPC. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package. With these two APIs, C++ developers can easily convert OFT files to HTML and then export HTML to FLATOPC.

1. Open OFT file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert OFT to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to FLATOPC format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set FlatOpc as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the OFT file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.oft");
// save OFT as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing FlatOpc as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.FlatOpc");

Not only you can convert your OFT to FLATOPC, but you can read, manipulate, and parse OFT document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.oft");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from OFT to FLATOPC. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.FlatOpc");
```
