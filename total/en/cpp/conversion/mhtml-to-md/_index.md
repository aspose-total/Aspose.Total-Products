<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save and share web content. It is a combination of HTML code and resources like images, audio, and video. It is used to save webpages for offline viewing and is supported by most web browsers. MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text. It is used to create webpages, documents, and other text-based content. Converting MHTML to MD is beneficial for creating webpages, documents, and other text-based content quickly and easily.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MHTML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MHTML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
