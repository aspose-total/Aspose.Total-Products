<h2>Converting CGM to CSV in C++</h2>

Converting CGM to CSV in C++ is a simple two step process that can be achieved with the help of [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) file format automation libraries. The first step involves exporting CGM to XLSX by using [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/). This is followed by the second step, which involves converting XLSX to CSV by using [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/) Spreadsheet Programming API. 

The process of converting CGM to CSV in C++ is quite straightforward and can be completed in a few simple steps. To begin, the user needs to install the Aspose.Total for C++ libraries. This will provide access to the Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Cells for C++ libraries, which are necessary for the conversion process. 

Once the libraries are installed, the user can then use the Aspose.PDF for C++ library to export the CGM file to XLSX. This is done by simply loading the CGM file into the library and then using the library's export function to convert it to XLSX. 

The second step involves using the Aspose.Cells for C++ library to convert the XLSX file to CSV. This is done by loading the XLSX file into the library and then using the library's save function to convert it to CSV. This process is quick and easy and can be completed in a few simple steps. 

Once the conversion process is complete, the user will have a CSV file that is ready to be used in any application that supports the CSV format. This makes it easy to share data between different applications and platforms. 

Overall, converting CGM to CSV in C++ is a simple two step process that can be completed quickly and easily with the help of the Aspose.Total for C++ file format automation libraries. This makes it easy to share data between different applications and platforms.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your CGM document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a CGM file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save CSV File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving CSV file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
