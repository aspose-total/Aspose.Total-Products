<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. One of the most common conversions is from EML file format to HTML. This conversion is necessary for a variety of reasons, such as to make the email content more accessible to users, to make it easier to share the content with others, or to make the content easier to view on different devices.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EML to PCL Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with your email conversion needs. It includes two APIs that can help you convert EML to HTML and then export HTML to PCL. The first API is Aspose.Email for C++, which can be used to convert EML file format to HTML. The second API is Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to export HTML to PCL. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy to access both APIs in one convenient package. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can quickly and easily convert EML to PCL, allowing you to add email conversion features to your applications.

1. Open EML file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EML to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to PCL format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Pcl as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EML file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.eml");
// save EML as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Pcl as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Pcl");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EML File via C++" %}}
Not only you can convert your EML to PCL, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EML document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.eml");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EML to PCL. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Pcl");
```
