<h2>Why to Convert PCL to XAML?</h2>

C++ developers often need to convert PCL (Printer Command Language) to XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) in order to integrate the PCL conversion feature into their C++ applications. XAML is a declarative XML-based language used to create user interfaces in .NET applications. It is used to define objects and their properties, events, and methods.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to XAML Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents, images, and other file formats. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to convert PCL to XAML.

To convert PCL to XAML, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export PCL to PPTX. Then, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to XAML. Both APIs are available in the Aspose.Total for C++ package.

The Aspose.PDF for C++ API provides a wide range of features for working with PDF documents, such as creating, editing, and converting PDFs. It also supports the conversion of PCL to PDF, which can then be exported to PPTX.

The Aspose.Slides for C++ API provides a wide range of features for working with PPTX documents, such as creating, editing, and converting PPTX files. It also supports the conversion of PPTX to XAML.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily convert PCL to XAML in two simple steps. This makes it easier for developers to integrate the PCL conversion feature into their C++ applications.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.pcl");
// save PCL as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Xaml format
prs->Save(u"output.xaml", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to XAML, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in XAML File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to XAML, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a XAML file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.xaml");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.xaml", SaveFormat::Xaml);
