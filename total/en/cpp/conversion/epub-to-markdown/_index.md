<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to MARKDOWN</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, and is widely used for digital publications. However, the MARKDOWN format is becoming increasingly popular for web content, as it is easy to read and write, and is supported by many popular content management systems. Converting EPUB to MARKDOWN can therefore be beneficial for web content creators, as it allows them to easily create content that is compatible with a wide range of platforms.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to MARKDOWN Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a file format automation library that allows C++ developers to easily convert EPUB to MARKDOWN in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert the EPUB file format to DOC. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export the DOC to MARKDOWN. This makes it easy for C++ developers to quickly and easily convert EPUB to MARKDOWN, without having to manually convert the file formats. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other file format automation tools, making it a powerful and versatile library for C++ developers.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to MARKDOWN format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of EPUB Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering EPUB to MARKDOWN, you can open a password protected EPUB and also change its password. In order to change the password of a EPUB file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing EPUB Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.epub", L"owner");
// change password of EPUB Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict MARKDOWN File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict MARKDOWN file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Markdown");  
```
