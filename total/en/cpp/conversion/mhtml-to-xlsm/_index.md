<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to XLSM?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save webpages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources such as images, audio, and video. XLSM is a Microsoft Excel macro-enabled workbook file format used to store data and macros. It is a binary file format that is used to store data in a tabular form. Converting MHTML to XLSM is beneficial when you need to store data in a tabular form or when you need to use macros in the workbook.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MHTML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MHTML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
