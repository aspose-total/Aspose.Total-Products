<h2>Why to Convert PPSX to JSON</h2>

The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is a popular data interchange format used for exchanging data between different applications. It is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data exchange format that is easy for humans and machines to read and write. JSON is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is also used for storing data in a file or database.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
