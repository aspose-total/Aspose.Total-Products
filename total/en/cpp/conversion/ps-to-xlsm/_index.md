<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting from PostScript (PS) to Microsoft Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (XLSM) is a common requirement for many businesses. XLSM is a file format that allows users to store data in a tabular format and also to create macros and scripts to automate tasks. It is a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for PS to XLSM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that makes it easy to convert PS to XLSM. It provides two powerful APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Cells for C++, which can be used together to perform the conversion. 

The first step is to export PS to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for C++. This API provides a wide range of features for working with PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF to other popular file formats such as XLSX. 

Once the PS document has been converted to XLSX, the next step is to use Aspose.Cells for C++ to convert XLSX to XLSM. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with spreadsheets, including the ability to convert XLSX to XLSM. 

Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy to convert PS to XLSM in C++. It provides two powerful APIs that can be used together to perform the conversion in a simple two-step process. This makes it an ideal solution for businesses that need to convert PS documents to XLSM.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set PS File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PS document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PS file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving XLSM file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
