<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TEX is a document preparation system used for typesetting documents. It is a markup language that is used to create documents with a structured layout. It is widely used in the scientific and academic community for writing research papers, theses, and other documents. However, it is not as popular as other document formats such as Microsoft Word or Markdown. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert TEX documents to other formats for sharing and editing.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to MD Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive file format automation library that enables developers to easily convert TEX to MD. It is a two-step process that involves exporting TEX to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for C++ and then converting XLSX to MD using Aspose.Cells for C++. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful PDF manipulation library that enables developers to export TEX documents to XLSX format. Aspose.Cells for C++ is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to convert XLSX documents to MD format. Both libraries are part of the Aspose.Total for C++ package, which makes it easy to convert TEX to MD in C++.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set TEX File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your TEX document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a TEX file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MD File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving MD file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
