<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOTX file format is a Microsoft Word template file used to create documents with a consistent look and feel. It is used to store text, images, and other content that can be used to create a document. However, the DOTX file format is not compatible with Microsoft Excel, which uses the XLTX file format. Therefore, in order to use the content of a DOTX file in Microsoft Excel, it must be converted to the XLTX file format.
