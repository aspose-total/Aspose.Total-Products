<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to XAMLFLOW</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format that is used to save web pages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources such as images, audio, and video. XAMLFLOW is a markup language used to create documents with a combination of text, images, and other media. It is used to create documents that are easy to read and navigate. Converting MHTML to XAMLFLOW allows users to create documents that are more visually appealing and easier to read.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to XAMLFLOW Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a file format automation library that allows C++ developers to easily convert MHTML to XAMLFLOW in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert MHTML file format to DOC. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export DOC to XAMLFLOW. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert MHTML to XAMLFLOW without having to manually code the conversion process. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other features such as document manipulation, text extraction, and image manipulation, making it a powerful and versatile file format automation library.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MHTML to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to XAMLFLOW format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to XAMLFLOW, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict XAMLFLOW File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict XAMLFLOW file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Xamlflow");  
```
