<h2>Why to Convert PPTX to TSV</h2>

Presentations are a great way to convey information to an audience. However, sometimes it is necessary to convert a presentation to a different format in order to make it easier to work with. One such format is TSV (Tab Separated Values), which is a plain text format that can be used to store data in a tabular form. TSV is often used for data exchange between different applications, and it is also a popular format for data analysis.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPTX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TSV without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
