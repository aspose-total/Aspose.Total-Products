<h2>Why to Convert SVG to XAMLFLOW?</h2>

The XAMLFLOW format is a powerful and versatile file format that is used to create and store documents. It is an XML-based format that is used to store documents in a structured manner. It is widely used in the software development industry for creating documents such as user manuals, technical documents, and other documents. XAMLFLOW is also used to store data in a structured manner, which makes it easier to access and manipulate.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to XAMLFLOW, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict XAMLFLOW File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict XAMLFLOW file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Xamlflow");  
```
