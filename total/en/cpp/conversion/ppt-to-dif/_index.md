<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its compatibility with most operating systems and devices. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing or manipulating data. The Data Interchange Format (DIF) is a file format that is designed for data manipulation and is supported by many spreadsheet programs. Converting a PDF file to DIF allows users to edit and manipulate the data in the file.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PPT to DIF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats within C++ applications. It includes Aspose.Slides for C++ and Aspose.Cells for C++, which can be used to convert a PPT file to DIF. 

Using Aspose.Slides for C++, developers can export a PPT file to HTML. This HTML file can then be used as an input to Aspose.Cells for C++, which can convert the HTML file to DIF. This two-step process allows developers to quickly and easily convert PPT files to DIF within C++ applications. 

Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert various file formats, including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and more.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
