Are you a C++ developer looking to add to integrate XSLFO to PPTM conversion feature inside your C++ applications? You can do it in two simple steps. You can export XSLFO to PPTX by using [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/). Secondly, by using [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/), you can convert PPTX to PPTM. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) package.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pptm` as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load XSLFO file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.xslfo");
// save XSLFO as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Pptm format
prs->Save(u"output.pptm", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pptm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XSLFO Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XSLFO to PPTM, you can open a password protected XSLFO and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XSLFO file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XSLFO Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xslfo", L"owner");
// change password of XSLFO Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPTM File via C++" %}}
After converting XSLFO to PPTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pptm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pptm", SaveFormat::Pptm);
