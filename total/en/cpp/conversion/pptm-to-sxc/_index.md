<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application used to create them. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing or manipulating the content of the document. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PDF documents to other formats such as Microsoft Office Open XML Spreadsheet (SXC).

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to SXC without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
