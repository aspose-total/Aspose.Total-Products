<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a popular data format used for storing and exchanging data. It is a self-describing language and is used to store data in a structured manner. ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is a file format used for storing spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. It is an open standard maintained by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Converting XML to ODS is beneficial as it allows users to access and manipulate data stored in XML in a spreadsheet format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for xml to ods conversion</h2>
Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that enables developers to easily convert XML to ODS in C++. It consists of three components: Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Words for C++. The first step in the conversion process is to export XML to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for C++. This component allows developers to convert XML to XLSX with just a few lines of code. After that, Aspose.Cells for C++ can be used to convert XLSX to ODS. This component provides a comprehensive set of APIs that enable developers to manipulate spreadsheets in a variety of ways. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily convert XML to ODS in C++ with minimal effort.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set XML File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save ODS File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving ODS file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object’s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
