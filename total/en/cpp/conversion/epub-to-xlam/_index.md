<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to XLAM?</h2>

EPUB is a popular file format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format for digital books and publications, which is supported by most e-book readers. On the other hand, XLAM is a Microsoft Excel Open XML Macro-Enabled Workbook file format, which is used to store Excel workbooks with macros. XLAM files are used to store complex Excel workbooks with macros, which can be used to automate tasks in Excel. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to XLAM in order to use the macros in Excel.

Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
