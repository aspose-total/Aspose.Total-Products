<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is the process of transforming emails from one format to another. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as making emails easier to read, or to make them compatible with different email clients.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MSG to GIF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with email conversion. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to convert MSG file format to HTML, and then export HTML to GIF. Aspose.Email for C++ provides a set of classes for working with emails in various formats, such as MSG, EML, MHTML, and more. It also provides features for creating, reading, and manipulating emails. Aspose.Words for C++ is a powerful API for creating, editing, and converting documents. It supports a wide range of document formats, including HTML, and can be used to export HTML to GIF. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily add email conversion features to your applications.

1. Open MSG file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert MSG to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to GIF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Gif as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load the MSG file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save MSG as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Gif as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Gif");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse MSG File via C++" %}}
Not only you can convert your MSG to GIF, but you can read, manipulate, and parse MSG document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from MSG to GIF. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Gif");
```
