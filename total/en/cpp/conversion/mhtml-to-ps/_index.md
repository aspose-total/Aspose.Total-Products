<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to PS</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for businesses and individuals alike, as it is a secure, reliable, and easy to use format. PDFs are also highly versatile, as they can be viewed on any device, regardless of the operating system or software. However, the MHTML format is not as widely used, and is not as versatile as PDFs. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert MHTML files to PDFs in order to make them more accessible and easier to use.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to PS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that allows C++ developers to easily convert MHTML to PS in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert MHTML files to DOC. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export the DOC file to PS. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert MHTML files to PS, without having to manually convert the files. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other features, such as the ability to create, edit, and manipulate PDFs, as well as the ability to convert other file formats, such as HTML, XLS, and PPT.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MHTML to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to PS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to PS, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PS File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict PS file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Ps");  
```
