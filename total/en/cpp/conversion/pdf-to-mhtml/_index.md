<h2>Why to Convert PDF to MHTML</h2>

The MHTML format is a web page archive format that combines HTML, images, and other resources into a single file. It is used to save webpages for offline viewing, and is also used to send emails with embedded images. MHTML is a convenient way to store and share webpages, and is supported by most web browsers.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PDF Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PDF to MHTML, you can open a password protected PDF and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PDF file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PDF Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pdf", L"owner");
// change password of PDF Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict MHTML File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict MHTML file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Mhtml");  
```
