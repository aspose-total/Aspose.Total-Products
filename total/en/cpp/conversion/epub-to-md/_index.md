<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The EPUB format is a popular format for e-books, but it is not as widely supported as other formats such as MD. Converting EPUB to MD allows users to access their e-books on a wider range of devices and platforms. Additionally, MD is a more compact format, which makes it easier to store and share.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set EPUB File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your EPUB document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a EPUB file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save MD File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving MD file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
