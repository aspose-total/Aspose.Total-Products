<h2>Why to Convert PS to OTP?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer, you may need to integrate the PS to OTP conversion feature inside your C++ applications. This feature is useful for creating presentations, documents, and other types of files in the OTP format. It is also helpful for sharing the files with other users who may not have access to the original PS file.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to OTP Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you to export PS to PPTX and then convert PPTX to OTP. The process is simple and can be done in two steps. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export PS to PPTX. Secondly, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to OTP. Both APIs are available in the Aspose.Total for C++ package. This package also includes other APIs such as Aspose.Words for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Email for C++. All these APIs can help you to create, edit, and convert various types of documents, spreadsheets, and emails.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to OTP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Otp` as SaveFormat

doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PS to OTP, you can open a password protected PS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.ps", L"owner");
// change password of PS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in OTP File via C++" %}}
After converting PS to OTP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a OTP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a OTP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.otp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.otp", SaveFormat::Otp);
