<h2>Why to Convert MD to FODS</h2>

The MD (Markdown) format is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents. It is commonly used for writing documentation, blog posts, and other web content. On the other hand, FODS (Flat OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets, and is used for storing and exchanging data. Converting MD to FODS is necessary when you need to store data in a spreadsheet format, or when you need to share data with other users who use spreadsheet applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set MD File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MD document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MD file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
