<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add a feature to your application that allows for the conversion of TEX to POT, then you are in the right place. TEX is a typesetting language used to create documents, while POT is a presentation format used to create slideshows. Converting between the two formats can be a great way to make your documents more accessible and easier to share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to POT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with your TEX to POT conversion needs. It includes two APIs that can be used to export TEX to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POT. The first API is Aspose.PDF for C++, which can be used to export TEX to PPTX. The second API is Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to convert PPTX to POT. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy to get started with your TEX to POT conversion. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert TEX to POT in two simple steps. First, you can export TEX to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Then, you can convert PPTX to POT by using Aspose.Slides for C++. This makes it easy to add TEX to POT conversion features to your C++ applications. Aspose.Total for C++ is a great way to get started with your TEX to POT conversion needs.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pot` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load TEX file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.tex");
// save TEX as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Pot format
prs->Save(u"output.pot", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pot);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of TEX Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering TEX to POT, you can open a password protected TEX and also change its password. In order to change the password of a TEX file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing TEX Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.tex", L"owner");
// change password of TEX Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POT File via C++" %}}
After converting TEX to POT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pot");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pot", SaveFormat::Pot);
