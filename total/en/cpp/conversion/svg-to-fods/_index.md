<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web graphics, and is supported by most web browsers. FODS (Flat Open Document Spreadsheet) is a file format for spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. It is an open standard developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Converting SVG to FODS can be useful for creating spreadsheets with graphical elements, such as charts and diagrams.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for svg to fods conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to convert SVG to FODS. It consists of three components: Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Words for C++. The process of converting SVG to FODS is a simple two-step process. In the first step, you can export SVG to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. After that, by using Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to FODS. Aspose.Total for C++ provides a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating various file formats, including SVG, XLSX, and FODS. It is easy to use and can be integrated into any C++ application.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set SVG File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your SVG document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a SVG file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save FODS File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving FODS file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
