<h2>Why to Convert SVG to OTP</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web development and other applications. On the other hand, OTP (OpenType Font) is a format for scalable computer fonts. It is used to store fonts in a single file. Converting SVG to OTP is beneficial for developers as it allows them to use the fonts in their applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to OTP Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents in various formats. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, and other file formats. Using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily export SVG to PPTX and then convert PPTX to OTP.

To export SVG to PPTX, developers can use Aspose.PDF for C++. It is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also supports SVG to PPTX conversion.

To convert PPTX to OTP, developers can use Aspose.Slides for C++. It is a powerful presentation manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert presentations. It also supports PPTX to OTP conversion.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate SVG to OTP conversion feature inside their C++ applications in two simple steps. It is a cost-effective solution that saves time and effort for developers.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to OTP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Otp` as SaveFormat

doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to OTP, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in OTP File via C++" %}}
After converting SVG to OTP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a OTP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a OTP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.otp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.otp", SaveFormat::Otp);
