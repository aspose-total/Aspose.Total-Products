<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application used to create them. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing, and so it is often necessary to convert PDF files to other formats such as Microsoft Word (DOCM).

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to DOCM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert PS to DOCM in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert PS files to DOC. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export DOC to DOCM. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert PS files to DOCM. Furthermore, Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other features such as the ability to create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents, as well as the ability to convert between various document formats.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PS to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to DOCM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PS to DOCM, you can open a password protected PS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.ps", L"owner");
// change password of PS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOCM File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict DOCM file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Docm");  
```
