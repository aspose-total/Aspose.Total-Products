<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a popular data interchange format used to store and transport data. It is a text-based format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XLSB (Excel Binary File Format) is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel. It is a compressed version of the XLSX file format and is used to reduce the size of the file. Converting XML to XLSB can be beneficial in many ways. It can help reduce the size of the file, making it easier to store and transport. It can also help improve the performance of the application as XLSB files are faster to process than XML files.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set XML File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XLSB File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving XLSB file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
