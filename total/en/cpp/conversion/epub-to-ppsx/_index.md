<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add the ability to convert EPUB to PPSX files inside your C++ applications, then you will need to use a reliable and efficient solution. This is because EPUB and PPSX are two different file formats and require different APIs to convert between them.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to PPSX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It includes two APIs that are specifically designed to convert EPUB to PPSX files. The first is Aspose.PDF for C++, which can be used to export EPUB to PPTX. The second is Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to convert PPTX to PPSX. Both of these APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy to access and use them. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate EPUB to PPSX conversion into their C++ applications in just two simple steps. First, they can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export EPUB to PPTX. Then, they can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to PPSX. This makes it easy to add the ability to convert EPUB to PPSX files into C++ applications, without having to write any additional code. 

Aspose.Total for C++ is a powerful and reliable solution for developers who need to add the ability to convert EPUB to PPSX files into their C++ applications. It includes two APIs that are specifically designed for this purpose, making it easy to integrate EPUB to PPSX conversion into C++ applications in just two simple steps.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPSX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Ppsx` as SaveFormat

```cpp

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.epub");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of EPUB Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering EPUB to PPSX, you can open a password protected EPUB and also change its password. In order to change the password of a EPUB file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing EPUB Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.epub", L"owner");
// change password of EPUB Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPSX File via C++" %}}
After converting EPUB to PPSX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPSX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppsx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppsx", SaveFormat::Ppsx);
```
