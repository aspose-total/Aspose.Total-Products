<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to SWF?</h2>

EPUB is a popular format for digital books and publications, while SWF is a popular format for multimedia content. Converting EPUB to SWF allows developers to create interactive multimedia content from digital books and publications. This can be used to create engaging content for websites, presentations, and other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to SWF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate EPUB to SWF conversion into their C++ applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export EPUB to PPTX and then convert PPTX to SWF. Both APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features to help developers create interactive multimedia content from digital books and publications. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can quickly and easily add EPUB to SWF conversion to their C++ applications.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

// save EPUB as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of EPUB Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering EPUB to SWF, you can open a password protected EPUB and also change its password. In order to change the password of a EPUB file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing EPUB Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.epub", L"owner");
// change password of EPUB Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in SWF File via C++" %}}
After converting EPUB to SWF, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a SWF file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.swf");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.swf", SaveFormat::Swf);
```
