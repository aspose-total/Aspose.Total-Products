<h2>Why to Convert PPTM to XLSB</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular file format used for documents that require a high degree of accuracy and precision. However, PDFs are not always the best choice for data analysis and manipulation. In such cases, it is often more convenient to convert the PDF to a spreadsheet format such as XLSB. XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel that is optimized for storing large amounts of data. It is also more secure than other spreadsheet formats, making it ideal for sensitive data.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSB without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
