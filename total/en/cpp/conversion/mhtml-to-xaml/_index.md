<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Are you a C++ developer looking to add a feature to integrate MHTML to XAML conversion inside your C++ applications? MHTML is a web page archive format that is used to save webpages for offline viewing. XAML is a markup language used to create user interfaces for Windows applications. Converting MHTML to XAML can be useful for developers who want to create a Windows application with a web page interface.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to XAML Conversion</h2>

Converting MHTML to XAML can be done in two simple steps with the help of Aspose.Total for C++. Aspose.Total is a suite of APIs that provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for creating, editing, and converting documents. The first step is to export MHTML to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful library that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. The second step is to convert PPTX to XAML by using Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.Slides for C++ is a library that enables developers to create, edit, and convert presentations. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package. With the help of Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily convert MHTML to XAML in two simple steps.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MHTML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

// save MHTML as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to XAML, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in XAML File via C++" %}}
After converting MHTML to XAML, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a XAML file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.xaml");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.xaml", SaveFormat::Xaml);
```
