<h2>Why to Convert MD to PS?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for sharing documents due to its compatibility with most operating systems and devices. PDF files are also more secure than other file formats, as they cannot be easily edited or changed. However, the Markdown (MD) format is becoming increasingly popular for creating documents, as it is easier to use and more lightweight than other formats. Converting MD files to PDF can be beneficial for sharing documents with others, as it ensures that the document will be viewable on any device.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to PS Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive file format automation library that allows C++ developers to easily convert MD to PS in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert MD file format to DOC. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export DOC to PS. This makes it easy for C++ developers to quickly and easily convert MD files to PDF, without the need for any additional software or plugins. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other features, such as the ability to convert other file formats, create and manipulate documents, and more.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MD to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to PS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to PS, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PS File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict PS file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Ps");  
```
