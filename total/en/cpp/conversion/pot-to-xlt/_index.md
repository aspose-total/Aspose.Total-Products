<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is a popular choice for businesses and individuals alike due to its ability to maintain the original formatting of a document, regardless of the device or platform it is viewed on. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing, and so it is often necessary to convert it to another format such as Microsoft Excel (XLT).

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input POT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLT without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
