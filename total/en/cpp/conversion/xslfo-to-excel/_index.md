<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to EXCEL?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML-based language used to define the formatting of a document. It is used to describe the structure of a document, such as page layout, fonts, colors, and other formatting information. XSLFO is used to generate PDF documents, but it is not suitable for editing or manipulating data. On the other hand, EXCEL is a powerful spreadsheet application that is used to store, organize, and analyze data. It is widely used for data analysis and manipulation. Therefore, it is necessary to convert XSLFO to EXCEL in order to edit and manipulate the data.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XSLFO document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XSLFO file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
