<h2>Why to Convert PCL to OTP?</h2>

PCL (Printer Command Language) is a page description language used to control the printing process. It is a language that is used to control the printing process. It is a language that is used to control the printing process. It is a language that is used to control the printing process. On the other hand, OTP (Open Text Protocol) is a text-based protocol used to exchange documents between computers. It is a text-based protocol used to exchange documents between computers. It is a text-based protocol used to exchange documents between computers.

For many C++ developers, it is important to be able to convert PCL documents to OTP documents. This is because OTP documents are more widely used and accepted than PCL documents. OTP documents are more widely used and accepted than PCL documents. OTP documents are more widely used and accepted than PCL documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to OTP Conversion?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add PCL to OTP conversion feature inside your C++ applications, you can do it in two simple steps. You can export PCL to PPTX by using [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/). Secondly, by using [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/), you can convert PPTX to OTP. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) package.

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides developers with the ability to create, manipulate, and convert documents in various formats. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, Words, Cells, and Barcode. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful PDF manipulation API that allows developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also provides the ability to export PCL documents to PPTX. Aspose.Slides for C++ is a powerful API that allows developers to create, edit, and convert PPTX documents. It also provides the ability to convert PPTX documents to OTP.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily add PCL to OTP conversion feature inside their C++ applications. It is a powerful suite of APIs that provides developers with the ability to create, manipulate, and convert documents in various formats.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to OTP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Otp` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to OTP, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in OTP File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to OTP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a OTP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a OTP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.otp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.otp", SaveFormat::Otp);
