<h2>Why to Convert XML to POTX?</h2>

XML to POTX conversion is a useful feature for C++ developers who want to integrate XML documents into their applications. XML is a popular markup language used to store and transport data, while POTX is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. By converting XML to POTX, developers can easily create presentations from XML data and display them in their applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to POTX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to integrate XML to POTX conversion into their applications. The suite includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. With Aspose.PDF for C++, developers can export XML documents to PPTX format. Then, with Aspose.Slides for C++, they can convert PPTX to POTX. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert XML to POTX and integrate it into their applications.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XML to POTX, you can open a password protected XML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xml", L"owner");
// change password of XML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTX File via C++" %}}
After converting XML to POTX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potx", SaveFormat::Potx);
