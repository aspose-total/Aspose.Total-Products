By using [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) you can convert DOC to JSON format within your C++ applications. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/), you can export DOC to HTML. After that, by using [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/), you can convert HTML to JSON format.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input DOC document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. To do this, use a special constructor overload, which accepts a LoadOptions object. This object contains the Password property, which specifies the password string.
