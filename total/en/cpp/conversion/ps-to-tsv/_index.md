<h2>Why to Convert PS to TSV?</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system. However, the PDF format is not suitable for data analysis and manipulation. To perform data analysis, the data must be converted to a tabular format such as TSV (Tab Separated Values). TSV is a text-based format that is used to store tabular data in plain text. It is a popular format for data exchange between applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to TSV Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables developers to easily convert PS to TSV in C++. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and other libraries. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert PS to TSV in two steps. In the first step, you can export PS to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. After that, by using Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to TSV. This two-step process makes it easy to convert PS to TSV in C++. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a wide range of features and options that make it easy to customize the conversion process.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set PS File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PS document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PS file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save TSV File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving TSV file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
