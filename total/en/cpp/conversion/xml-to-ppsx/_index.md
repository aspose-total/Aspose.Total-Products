<h2>Why to Convert XML to PPSX?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer, you may need to integrate XML to PPSX conversion feature inside your C++ applications. This is because PPSX is a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation file format that is used to store slides in a single file. It is a compressed version of the PPTX file format and is used to reduce the size of the file.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to PPSX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that helps developers to work with a wide range of file formats. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export XML to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPSX respectively.

To export XML to PPTX, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++. It is a powerful PDF manipulation API that allows you to create, edit, convert, and manipulate PDF documents. It also supports the conversion of XML to PPTX format.

Once you have exported the XML to PPTX, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to PPSX. It is a powerful presentation manipulation API that allows you to create, edit, convert, and manipulate presentations. It also supports the conversion of PPTX to PPSX format.

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that can be used to export XML to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPSX. It is a great tool for C++ developers who need to integrate XML to PPSX conversion feature inside their C++ applications.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPSX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Ppsx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XML to PPSX, you can open a password protected XML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xml", L"owner");
// change password of XML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPSX File via C++" %}}
After converting XML to PPSX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPSX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppsx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppsx", SaveFormat::Ppsx);
