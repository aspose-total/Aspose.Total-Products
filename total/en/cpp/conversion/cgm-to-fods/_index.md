<h2>Why to Convert CGM to FODS</h2>

The CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format is a vector graphics format used to store and exchange graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. However, the FODS (Flat Open Document Spreadsheet) format is a spreadsheet format used to store and exchange data in a tabular form. Therefore, it is necessary to convert CGM to FODS in order to use the data in a spreadsheet.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to FODS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to convert CGM to FODS in C++. It is a simple two step process. In the first step, you can export CGM to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. After that, by using Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to FODS. 

Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful library for creating, editing, and converting PDF documents. It can be used to export CGM to XLSX by using the ExportToXLSX() method. This method takes the CGM file as an input and returns an XLSX file as an output.

Aspose.Cells for C++ is a powerful library for creating, editing, and converting spreadsheet documents. It can be used to convert XLSX to FODS by using the SaveToFods() method. This method takes the XLSX file as an input and returns a FODS file as an output.

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for C++ is a powerful suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to convert CGM to FODS in C++. It is a simple two step process that involves exporting CGM to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for C++ and then converting XLSX to FODS using Aspose.Cells for C++.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set CGM File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your CGM document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a CGM file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save FODS File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving FODS file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
