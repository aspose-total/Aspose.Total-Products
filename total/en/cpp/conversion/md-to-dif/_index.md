<h2>Why to Convert MD to DIF</h2>

MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that is used for formatting plain text documents. It is commonly used for writing web content, technical documentation, and notes. DIF (Data Interchange Format) is a text-based data interchange format that is used to transfer data between different applications. It is a popular format for exchanging data between spreadsheets, databases, and other applications. Converting MD to DIF allows users to transfer data between different applications and platforms.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MD document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MD file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
