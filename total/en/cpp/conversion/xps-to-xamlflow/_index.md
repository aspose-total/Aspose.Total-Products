<h2>Why to Convert XPS to XAMLFLOW</h2>

XAMLFLOW is a powerful file format that is used to create and edit documents. It is a markup language that is used to create documents with a wide range of features, such as text formatting, images, tables, and more. XAMLFLOW documents are also easily shared and can be opened in a variety of applications. XPS, on the other hand, is a file format that is used to store documents in a compressed format. It is not as feature-rich as XAMLFLOW, and it is not as easily shared or opened in other applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert XPS documents to XAMLFLOW in order to make them more accessible and easier to share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XPS to XAMLFLOW Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a file format automation library that allows C++ developers to easily convert XPS to XAMLFLOW in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert XPS file format to DOC. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export the DOC to XAMLFLOW. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily convert XPS documents to XAMLFLOW, without having to manually convert each document. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a wide range of other features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert a variety of file formats, including PDF, DOC, XLS, and more.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XPS to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to XAMLFLOW format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XPS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XPS to XAMLFLOW, you can open a password protected XPS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XPS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XPS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xps", L"owner");
// change password of XPS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict XAMLFLOW File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict XAMLFLOW file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Xamlflow");  
```
