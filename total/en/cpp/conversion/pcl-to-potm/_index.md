<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate PCL to POTM conversion feature inside your C++ applications. PCL (Printer Command Language) is a page description language used to control printing devices. POTM (PowerPoint Open XML Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations that contain macros. Converting PCL to POTM is a necessary step for C++ developers who need to integrate PCL to POTM conversion feature inside their applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to POTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents in various formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export PCL to PPTX and convert PPTX to POTM, respectively.

To export PCL to PPTX, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++. It is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert PDF documents. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to export PCL to PPTX.

To convert PPTX to POTM, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++. It is a powerful presentation manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert presentations. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to convert PPTX to POTM.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily export PCL to PPTX and convert PPTX to POTM in two simple steps. This makes it an ideal solution for C++ developers who need to integrate PCL to POTM conversion feature inside their applications.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to POTM, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTM File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to POTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potm", SaveFormat::Potm);
