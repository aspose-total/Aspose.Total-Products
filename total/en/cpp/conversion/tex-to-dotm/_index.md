<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

TEX is a popular document format used for creating and formatting documents. It is widely used in the scientific and academic communities for writing research papers and other documents. However, it is not supported by many applications and programs. Therefore, it is necessary to convert TEX to a more widely supported format such as DOTM.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert TEX to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to DOTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of TEX Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering TEX to DOTM, you can open a password protected TEX and also change its password. In order to change the password of a TEX file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing TEX Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.tex", L"owner");
// change password of TEX Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOTM File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict DOTM file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Dotm");  
```
