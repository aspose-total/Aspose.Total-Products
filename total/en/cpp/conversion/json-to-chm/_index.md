<h2>Why to Convert JSON to CHM</h2>

The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is a popular data interchange format used for exchanging data between different applications. It is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data exchange format that is easy for humans and machines to read and write. On the other hand, CHM (Compiled HTML Help) is a Microsoft proprietary online help format, used for providing help and documentation for Windows applications. It is a single file that contains HTML pages, images, and navigation. Therefore, it is necessary to convert JSON to CHM in order to make the data available in a format that can be used by Windows applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to CHM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats within their C++ applications. It includes APIs for manipulating documents, images, emails, and other file formats. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily parse JSON to CHM within their C++ applications in two simple steps. 

Firstly, by using Aspose.Cells for C++, developers can export JSON to PDF. Aspose.Cells for C++ is a powerful spreadsheet processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets within their C++ applications. It supports a wide range of features, including creating, reading, and writing spreadsheets, manipulating data, and converting spreadsheets to other popular file formats. 

After that, by using Aspose.Words for C++, developers can convert PDF to CHM. Aspose.Words for C++ is a powerful word processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents within their C++ applications. It supports a wide range of features, including creating, reading, and writing documents, manipulating data, and converting documents to other popular file formats. 

Therefore, with Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily parse JSON to CHM within their C++ applications in two simple steps.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PDF using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to CHM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout & Convert JSON Format to CHM in C++" %}}
While parsing JSON to CHM, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to CHM with Watermark in C++" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to CHM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your CHM document, you can first convert JSON to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class, set different properties for text watermark,
call SetText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to CHM.
