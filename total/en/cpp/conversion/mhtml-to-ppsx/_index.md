<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to PPSX?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format that combines HTML, images, and other resources into a single file. It is used to save webpages for offline viewing. PPSX (PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show) is a presentation format developed by Microsoft. It is used to store slideshows created using Microsoft PowerPoint. Therefore, if you are a C++ developer and want to add the feature of MHTML to PPSX conversion inside your C++ applications, you need to convert MHTML to PPSX.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for MHTML to PPSX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides a wide range of features for C++ developers. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, Words, Cells, and Email. To convert MHTML to PPSX, you can use two APIs from Aspose.Total for C++ package. First, you can use [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) to export MHTML to PPTX. Secondly, you can use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to convert PPTX to PPSX. Both APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features. Moreover, they are available as NuGet packages and can be easily integrated into your C++ applications.

```cpp
// load MHTML file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.mhtml");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Ppsx format
prs->Save(u"output.ppsx", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Ppsx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to PPSX, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPSX File via C++" %}}
After converting MHTML to PPSX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPSX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppsx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppsx", SaveFormat::Ppsx);
