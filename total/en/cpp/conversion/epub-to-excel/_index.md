<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to EXCEL?</h2>

EPUB is a popular file format for e-books, and it is widely used by publishers and readers alike. However, it is not suitable for data analysis or manipulation. EXCEL, on the other hand, is a powerful spreadsheet application that allows users to perform complex calculations, create charts and graphs, and store large amounts of data. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert EPUB files to EXCEL in order to make use of the data contained within them.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to Excel Conversion?</h2>

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set EPUB File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your EPUB document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a EPUB file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving EXCEL file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
