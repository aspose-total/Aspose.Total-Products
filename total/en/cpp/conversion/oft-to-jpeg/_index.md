<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. One of the most common conversions is from OFT file format to HTML. This conversion is necessary to ensure that the emails are displayed correctly in the application.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OFT to JPEG Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that can help you with the conversion of OFT files to HTML. The suite includes Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++. Aspose.Email for C++ is an API that can be used to convert OFT files to HTML. After the conversion, Aspose.Words for C++ can be used to export the HTML to JPEG. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package. This package provides a comprehensive set of APIs that can be used to convert emails, documents, and images. With the help of Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert OFT files to JPEG.

1. Open OFT file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert OFT to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Jpeg as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the OFT file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.oft");
// save OFT as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Jpeg as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Jpeg");

Not only you can convert your OFT to JPEG, but you can read, manipulate, and parse OFT document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.oft");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());
```

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from OFT to JPEG. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Jpeg");
```
