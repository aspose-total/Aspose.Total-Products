<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to POTM</h2>

C++ developers often need to integrate XSLFO to POTM conversion feature inside their applications. XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML document formatting which is most commonly used to generate PDF documents. POTM (PowerPoint Open XML Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to save presentations that contain macros. Converting XSLFO to POTM allows C++ developers to create presentations with macros from XML documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XSLFO to POTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, manipulate, and convert a variety of file formats. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert XSLFO to POTM: Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++.

Aspose.PDF for C++ can be used to export XSLFO to PPTX, which is the native format of Microsoft PowerPoint. Aspose.Slides for C++ can then be used to convert the PPTX file to POTM. Both APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features that make it easy to create and manipulate documents.

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for C++ is an ideal solution for C++ developers who need to integrate XSLFO to POTM conversion feature inside their applications. It provides two APIs that can be used to easily and quickly convert XSLFO to POTM.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.xslfo");
// save XSLFO as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XSLFO Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XSLFO to POTM, you can open a password protected XSLFO and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XSLFO file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XSLFO Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xslfo", L"owner");
// change password of XSLFO Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTM File via C++" %}}
After converting XSLFO to POTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potm", SaveFormat::Potm);
```
