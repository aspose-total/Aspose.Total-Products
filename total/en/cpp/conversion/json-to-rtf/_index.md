By using [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) you can parse JSON to RTF within your C++ applications in two simple steps. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/), you can export JSON to PDF. After that, by using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cppp/), you can convert PDF to RTF.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PDF using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to RTF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method

While parsing JSON to RTF, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to RTF with Watermark in C++" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to RTF with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your RTF document, you can first convert JSON to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class, set different properties for text watermark,
call SetText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to RTF.
