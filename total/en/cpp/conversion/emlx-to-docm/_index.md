<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. For example, you may need to convert EMLX file format to HTML. This is because HTML is a widely used format for webpages and documents, and is supported by many applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMLX to DOCM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that can help you with email conversion. It includes [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) and [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/). Aspose.Email for C++ can be used to convert EMLX file format to HTML. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ API can be used to export HTML to DOCM. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert EMLX file format to HTML and then export HTML to DOCM. The APIs are easy to use and can be integrated into your applications quickly. Moreover, they are reliable and secure, so you can be sure that your data is safe.

1. Open EMLX file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMLX to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to DOCM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Docm as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load the EMLX file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.emlx");
// save EMLX as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Docm as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Docm");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EMLX File via C++" %}}
Not only you can convert your EMLX to DOCM, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMLX document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.emlx");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMLX to DOCM. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Docm");
```
