<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. One of the most common conversion tasks is to convert OFT file format to HTML. This is necessary to ensure that the emails are compatible with the application and can be used without any issues.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OFT to DOTX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help you with the conversion of OFT files to HTML. It includes two APIs, namely Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++. Aspose.Email for C++ can be used to convert OFT file format to HTML. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ API can be used to export HTML to DOTX. This way, Aspose.Total for C++ can help you with the conversion of OFT files to DOTX. Moreover, the APIs are easy to use and can be integrated into your applications with minimal effort.

1. Open OFT file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert OFT to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to DOTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Dotx as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the OFT file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.oft");
// save OFT as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Dotx as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Dotx");

Not only you can convert your OFT to DOTX, but you can read, manipulate, and parse OFT document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.oft");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from OFT to DOTX. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Dotx");
```
