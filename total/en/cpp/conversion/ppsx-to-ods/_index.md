<h2>Why to Convert PPSX to ODS?</h2>

The Portable Presentation Format (PPSX) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a combination of the PowerPoint binary file format and the XML-based Office Open XML format.

ODS is a part of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) and is used to store data in a tabular form.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to ODS without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
