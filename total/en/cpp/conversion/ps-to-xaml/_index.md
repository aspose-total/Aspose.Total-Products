<h2>Why to Convert PS to XAML?</h2>

C++ developers often need to integrate PS to XAML conversion feature inside their applications. XAML is a markup language used to create user interfaces for Windows applications. It is a powerful language that allows developers to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. PS, on the other hand, is a popular image format used to store and share digital images. Converting PS to XAML allows developers to create visually appealing user interfaces for their applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to XAML Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate PS to XAML conversion feature inside their applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export PS to PPTX and convert PPTX to XAML respectively. Aspose.PDF for C++ allows developers to export PS to PPTX in just two simple steps. Once the PS is converted to PPTX, Aspose.Slides for C++ can be used to convert PPTX to XAML. Aspose.Total for C++ is a reliable and cost-effective solution for developers looking to integrate PS to XAML conversion feature inside their applications.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

```cpp

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.ps");
// save PS as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Xaml format
prs->Save(u"output.xaml", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PS to XAML, you can open a password protected PS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.ps", L"owner");
// change password of PS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in XAML File via C++" %}}
After converting PS to XAML, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a XAML file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.xaml");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.xaml", SaveFormat::Xaml);
