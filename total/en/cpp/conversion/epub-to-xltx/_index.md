<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to XLTX?</h2>

EPUB is a popular file format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format for digital books and publications, which is supported by most of the e-book readers. However, it is not supported by Microsoft Excel, which is the most popular spreadsheet application. Therefore, if you want to open and view the content of an EPUB file in Excel, you need to convert it to the XLTX format.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your EPUB document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a EPUB file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
