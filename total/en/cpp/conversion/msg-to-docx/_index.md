<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. This could be to convert emails from one format to another, such as from MSG to HTML.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MSG to DOCX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that can help you with this task. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++. Aspose.Email for C++ can be used to convert MSG file format to HTML. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ API can be used to export HTML to DOCX. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package. This package also includes other APIs that can help you with other tasks related to document processing, such as creating, editing, and converting documents. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily add email conversion features to your applications. It is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with a wide range of tasks related to document processing. It is easy to use and can save you time and effort when it comes to adding email conversion features to your applications.

1. Open MSG file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert MSG to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to DOCX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Docx as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load the MSG file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save MSG as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Docx as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Docx");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse MSG File via C++" %}}
Not only you can convert your MSG to DOCX, but you can read, manipulate, and parse MSG document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from MSG to DOCX. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Docx");
```
