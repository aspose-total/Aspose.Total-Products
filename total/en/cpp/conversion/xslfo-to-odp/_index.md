<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to ODP?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML document formatting. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting details. ODP (OpenDocument Presentation) is a file format for presentations created by the OpenDocument community. It is an open standard for electronic documents, such as spreadsheets, charts, presentations, and word processing documents. Converting XSLFO to ODP allows users to create presentations with a wide range of features, including animations, transitions, and multimedia.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XSLFO to ODP Conversion?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add XSLFO to ODP conversion feature inside your C++ applications, you can do it in two simple steps. You can export XSLFO to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, by using Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to ODP. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for creating, editing, and converting documents. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, Words, Cells, and Barcode. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily add XSLFO to ODP conversion feature to their C++ applications.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to ODP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Odp` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load XSLFO file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.xslfo");
// save XSLFO as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Odp format
prs->Save(u"output.odp", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Odp);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XSLFO Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XSLFO to ODP, you can open a password protected XSLFO and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XSLFO file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XSLFO Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xslfo", L"owner");
// change password of XSLFO Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in ODP File via C++" %}}
After converting XSLFO to ODP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a ODP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a ODP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.odp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.odp", SaveFormat::Odp);
```
