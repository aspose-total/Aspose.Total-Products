[Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) is complete package of C++ File Format Automation libraries. By using the rich features of the APIs avaiable in the pacakge, we can easily convert PowerPoint PPT to Word FLATOPC. In order to perform the conversion, you can first use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) API to convert PPT to HTML.
