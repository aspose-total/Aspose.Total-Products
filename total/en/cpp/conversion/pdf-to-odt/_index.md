<h2>Why to Convert PDF to ODT</h2>

The OpenDocument Text (ODT) format is an open standard for word processing documents. It is an XML-based file format that is used for creating and storing text documents such as reports, books, and brochures. ODT files are compatible with many different applications, including Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice. As such, it is a popular choice for sharing documents between different platforms.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PDF to ODT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert PDF to ODT in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert PDF file format to DOC. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to ODT. 

Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents from within their own applications. It supports a wide range of features, including text extraction, image extraction, page manipulation, and more. Aspose.Words for C++ is a powerful Word document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert Word documents from within their own applications. It supports a wide range of features, including document conversion, text manipulation, document comparison, and more.

By combining the power of Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, developers can easily convert PDF to ODT in two simple steps. This makes it easy for developers to share documents between different platforms, without having to worry about compatibility issues.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PDF Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PDF to ODT, you can open a password protected PDF and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PDF file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PDF Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pdf", L"owner");
// change password of PDF Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict ODT File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict ODT file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Odt");  
```
