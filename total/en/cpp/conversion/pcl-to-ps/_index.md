<h2>Why to Convert PCL to PS?</h2>

The Printer Command Language (PCL) is a page description language used to control the printing of documents on laser printers and other output devices. It is a language developed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) to provide a means of controlling the printing process. PostScript (PS) is a page description language used to describe the appearance of a printed page in a device-independent and resolution-independent format. It is a language developed by Adobe Systems to provide a means of controlling the printing process. Converting PCL to PS is necessary to ensure that the document is printed correctly on any device.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for PCL to PS Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that allows C++ developers to easily convert PCL to PS in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert PCL file format to DOC. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert PCL to DOC. Secondly, by using the advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to PS. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate Word documents, including the ability to convert DOC to PS. Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy for C++ developers to convert PCL to PS quickly and easily.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to PS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to PS, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PS File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict PS file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Ps");  
```
