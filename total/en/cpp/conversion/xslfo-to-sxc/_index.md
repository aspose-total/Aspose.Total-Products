<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to SXC?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML-based markup language used to describe the formatting of a document. It is used to generate PDF documents from XML data. SXC (OpenOffice Spreadsheet) is a spreadsheet format used by OpenOffice Calc. It is an open source spreadsheet application that is used to create, edit, and save spreadsheets. Converting XSLFO to SXC is beneficial as it allows users to open and edit the document in OpenOffice Calc.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set XSLFO File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XSLFO document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XSLFO file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
