<h2>Why to Convert PCL to XLSM?</h2>

PCL (Printer Command Language) is a page description language used by printers to interpret and render documents. It is a language that is used to control the printing process. XLSM (Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook) is a Microsoft Excel file format that stores macros and other programming code. It is used to store and share data in a structured format. Converting PCL to XLSM allows users to access the data stored in the PCL file in a more user-friendly format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set PCL File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PCL document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PCL file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
