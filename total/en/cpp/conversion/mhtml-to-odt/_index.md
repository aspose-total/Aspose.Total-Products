<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to ODT</h2>

The OpenDocument Text (ODT) format is a popular open standard for document exchange, and is widely used for creating and sharing documents. It is an XML-based file format, and is supported by many popular applications, including Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, and OpenOffice. Converting MHTML to ODT allows users to open and edit documents in any of these applications, and to share documents with others who may not have access to the original MHTML file.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to ODT, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict ODT File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict ODT file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Odt");  
```
