<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add a feature to your applications that allows for the conversion of TEX to POWERPOINT, then you are in the right place. This conversion is necessary for a variety of reasons, such as creating presentations from existing documents, or for the purpose of sharing documents with colleagues or clients.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to PowerPoint Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with the conversion of TEX to POWERPOINT. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export TEX to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POWERPOINT, respectively. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export TEX to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow you to convert TEX documents to PPTX format with ease. It also supports a variety of other formats, such as HTML, PDF, XPS, and more. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to POWERPOINT. This API provides a comprehensive set of features that allow you to convert PPTX documents to POWERPOINT format with ease. It also supports a variety of other formats, such as PDF, HTML, XPS, and more. 

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with the conversion of TEX to POWERPOINT. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export TEX to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POWERPOINT, respectively. With these APIs, you can easily add the feature of TEX to POWERPOINT conversion to your C++ applications.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Ppt` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of TEX Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering TEX to POWERPOINT, you can open a password protected TEX and also change its password. In order to change the password of a TEX file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing TEX Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.tex", L"owner");
// change password of TEX Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POWERPOINT File via C++" %}}
After converting TEX to POWERPOINT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POWERPOINT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POWERPOINT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.powerpoint");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.powerpoint", SaveFormat::Ppt);
```
