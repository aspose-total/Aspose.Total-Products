<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to XLT?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save web pages in a single file. It is a combination of HTML code and resources like images, audio, and video. It is used to save web pages for offline viewing and sharing. XLT is an Excel template file format used to store a workbook template. It is used to create new workbooks with predefined settings and data. Converting MHTML to XLT is beneficial when you want to create a workbook with predefined settings and data from a web page.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to XLT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that helps developers to work with various file formats. It provides APIs to export MHTML to XLSX and convert XLSX to XLT. In the first step, you can export MHTML to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. After that, by using Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to XLT. This two-step process is simple and easy to implement. It helps developers to quickly convert MHTML to XLT without any manual effort.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set MHTML File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MHTML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MHTML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XLT File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving XLT file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
