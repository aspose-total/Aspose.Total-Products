<h2>Why to Convert JSON to PPS</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based, human-readable format that is used to represent simple data structures and objects. PPS (PowerPoint Show) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations. It is a binary file format that stores the presentation in a single file. Converting JSON to PPS is beneficial for those who want to store their data in a more secure and organized manner.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) method

While parsing JSON to PPS, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPS with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPS document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class, get the first slide, Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type, add TextFrame to the Rectangle, create the Paragraph object for a text frame, create Portion object for paragraph, add watermark using set_Text() and, can save the document to PPS.
