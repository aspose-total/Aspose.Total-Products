<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to XLTX?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML document formatting. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting information. XLTX (XML Template) is a file format used by Microsoft Excel to store worksheets. It is an XML-based format that stores data in a tabular format, similar to a spreadsheet. Converting XSLFO to XLTX allows users to take advantage of the features and capabilities of Excel, such as data analysis, charting, and formatting.
