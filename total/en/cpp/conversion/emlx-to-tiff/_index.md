<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. This could be for a variety of reasons, such as to make the emails more accessible to a wider audience, or to make them easier to store and manage.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EMLX to TIFF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, edit, and convert documents, emails, and other file formats. It includes two APIs that are particularly useful for email conversion: Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++.

Using Aspose.Email for C++, you can convert EMLX file format to HTML. After that, by using Aspose.Words for C++ API, you can export HTML to TIFF. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy to access both APIs in one convenient package.

The Aspose.Email for C++ API is a powerful tool for email conversion, allowing you to convert emails from EMLX to HTML quickly and easily. It also provides a range of other features, such as the ability to read and write emails in various formats, and the ability to access email attachments.

The Aspose.Words for C++ API is a powerful tool for document conversion, allowing you to convert HTML to TIFF quickly and easily. It also provides a range of other features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert documents in various formats, and the ability to access document elements.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily access both Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, making it easy to convert emails from EMLX to TIFF. This makes it easy to add email conversion features to your applications, allowing you to quickly and easily convert emails from EMLX to TIFF.

1. Open EMLX file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMLX to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to TIFF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Tiff as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EMLX file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.emlx");
// save EMLX as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Tiff as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Tiff");

Not only you can convert your EMLX to TIFF, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMLX document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.emlx");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMLX to TIFF. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Tiff");
```
