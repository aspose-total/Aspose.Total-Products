<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web graphics, and can also be used for print graphics. DIF (Data Interchange Format) is a text-based data interchange format used to store data in a tabular form. It is used to transfer data between different applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and other programs. Converting SVG to DIF can be useful for transferring data between different applications, or for creating printable documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for svg to dif conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to convert SVG to DIF in C++. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and other libraries. The process is simple and straightforward. In the first step, you can export SVG to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. After that, by using Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to DIF. This process is fast and efficient, and can be used to quickly convert SVG to DIF in C++.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set SVG File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your SVG document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a SVG file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DIF File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving DIF file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
