<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to XLAM?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save web pages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources such as images, audio, and video. XLAM is an Excel Add-in file format used to store macros, user-defined functions, and other data. Converting MHTML to XLAM is beneficial when you need to store web page content in an Excel file format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for MHTML to XLAM Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that enables developers to convert MHTML to XLAM in C++. It consists of three components: Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Words for C++. The process of converting MHTML to XLAM is a simple two-step process. 

In the first step, you can export MHTML to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. This component provides a set of APIs to create, read, and manipulate PDF documents. It also allows you to convert PDF documents to other popular file formats such as XLSX, HTML, and MHTML. 

In the second step, you can convert XLSX to XLAM by using Aspose.Cells for C++. This component provides a set of APIs to create, read, and manipulate spreadsheets. It also allows you to convert spreadsheets to other popular file formats such as XLAM, XLSM, and XLSB. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy to convert MHTML to XLAM in C++. It provides a set of APIs to export MHTML to XLSX and convert XLSX to XLAM. This makes it possible to store web page content in an Excel file format.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MHTML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MHTML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
