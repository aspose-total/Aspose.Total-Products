<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

PDF to XLSB conversion is a popular requirement in the field of file format automation. XLSB is a binary file format used by Microsoft Excel that is used to store spreadsheet data. It is a compressed version of the XLSX file format and is used to reduce the size of the file. It is also more secure than XLSX as it is not easily readable by humans.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PDF document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PDF file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
