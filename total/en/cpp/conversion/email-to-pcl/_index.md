<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is a process of transforming an email file format into another format. This process is necessary to make the email file compatible with other applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for email to PCL conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that helps developers to work with various file formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to convert an EMAIL file format to HTML and then export HTML to PCL. Aspose.Email for C++ is a powerful API that enables developers to convert emails from one format to another. It supports a wide range of email formats, including MSG, EML, MHTML, and EMLX. Aspose.Words for C++ is a powerful API that enables developers to convert HTML documents to PCL. It supports a wide range of document formats, including DOC, DOCX, ODT, and HTML.

Using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily convert an EMAIL file format to HTML and then export HTML to PCL. The APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features that make the conversion process easier. Moreover, the APIs are highly reliable and provide excellent performance.

1. Open EMAIL file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMAIL to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to PCL format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Pcl as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with C++ File Format APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EMAIL file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save EMAIL as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Pcl as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Pcl");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EMAIL File via C++" %}}
Not only you can convert your EMAIL to PCL, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMAIL document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMAIL to PCL. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Pcl");
```
