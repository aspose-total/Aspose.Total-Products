<h2>Why to Convert SVG to PPTM</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web development and other graphical applications. PPTM (PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a macro-enabled version of the PPTX format and supports macros, ActiveX controls, and other features. Converting SVG to PPTM can be useful for creating presentations with interactive elements.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pptm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to PPTM, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPTM File via C++" %}}
After converting SVG to PPTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pptm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pptm", SaveFormat::Pptm);
