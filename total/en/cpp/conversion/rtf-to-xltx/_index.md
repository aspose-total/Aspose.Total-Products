<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

RTF (Rich Text Format) is a document format developed by Microsoft in 1987 for exchanging text between different word processors. It is a popular format for exchanging documents between different platforms and applications. However, it is not supported by all applications. XLTX (Excel Open XML Spreadsheet) is a file format developed by Microsoft for storing and exchanging data in spreadsheet form. It is supported by many applications and is a popular format for exchanging data between different platforms and applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert RTF documents to XLTX format.
