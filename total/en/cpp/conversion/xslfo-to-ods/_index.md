<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to ODS?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML-based markup language used to define the formatting of a document. It is used to generate PDF documents from XML documents. On the other hand, ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets. It is used to store data in a tabular format. Converting XSLFO to ODS is beneficial for users who want to store their data in a tabular format and also want to access it in a spreadsheet application.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for XSLFO to ODS Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that enables developers to easily convert XSLFO to ODS in C++. It consists of three components: Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Words for C++. With the help of these components, developers can easily export XSLFO to XLSX and then convert XLSX to ODS. 

The first step in the process is to export XSLFO to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. This component provides a set of APIs that enable developers to easily convert XSLFO to XLSX. It also provides features such as text extraction, image extraction, and text search. 

The second step is to convert XLSX to ODS by using Aspose.Cells for C++. This component provides a set of APIs that enable developers to easily convert XLSX to ODS. It also provides features such as data validation, data sorting, and data filtering. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy for developers to convert XSLFO to ODS in C++. It provides a set of APIs that enable developers to easily export XSLFO to XLSX and then convert XLSX to ODS. It also provides features such as text extraction, image extraction, text search, data validation, data sorting, and data filtering.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set XSLFO File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XSLFO document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XSLFO file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save ODS File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving ODS file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
