<h2>Why to Convert</h2>
The DOTM format is a Microsoft Office Open XML document template used by Microsoft Word. It is a file format used to store documents and other related data. It is a widely used format for creating and sharing documents. However, it is not compatible with many other applications and platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to convert DOTM to other formats such as JSON in order to make it compatible with other applications and platforms.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected DOTM to JSON Format via C++" %}}
Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input DOTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. To do this, use a special constructor overload, which accepts a LoadOptions object. This object contains the Password property, which specifies the password string.
