<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to ODS?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format that is used to save web pages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources such as images, audio, and video. On the other hand, ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets, which is used for storing tabular data. It is a popular format for creating and sharing spreadsheets. Therefore, it is necessary to convert MHTML to ODS in order to access the data stored in MHTML files in a spreadsheet format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for MHTML to ODS Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to convert MHTML to ODS in C++. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and other components. In the first step, you can export MHTML to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. After that, by using Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert XLSX to ODS. This two-step process is simple and efficient, and it can be used to quickly convert MHTML to ODS in C++.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set MHTML File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MHTML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MHTML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save ODS File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving ODS file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
