<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is the process of transforming emails from one format to another. This is useful for archiving emails, or for making them easier to read and share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MSG to Word Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert MSG files to HTML and then export HTML to WORD. The first API is Aspose.Email for C++, which can be used to convert MSG files to HTML. The second API is Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to export HTML to WORD. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy to use both APIs together. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can quickly and easily add email conversion features to their applications.

1. Open MSG file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert MSG to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to DOCX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Docx as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the MSG file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save MSG as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Docx as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Docx");

Not only you can convert your MSG to WORD, but you can read, manipulate, and parse MSG document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());
```

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from MSG to WORD. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Docx");
```
