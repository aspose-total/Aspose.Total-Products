<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to CSV?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML-based language used to define the formatting of a document. It is used to create documents such as PDFs, PostScript, and other printable documents. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a plain text format used for storing tabular data. It is often used to exchange data between different applications. Converting XSLFO to CSV can be useful for data analysis, data visualization, and other data processing tasks.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XSLFO document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XSLFO file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
