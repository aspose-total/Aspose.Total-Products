<h2>Why to Convert SVG to POTX?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add a feature to your applications that allows for SVG to POTX conversion, then you are in the right place. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. POTX (PowerPoint Open XML Template) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store slide templates. Converting SVG to POTX allows you to create presentations with a consistent look and feel, as well as to save time by reusing existing templates.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to POTX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, manipulate, and convert documents, images, and other file formats. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert SVG to POTX: Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. 

Using Aspose.PDF for C++, you can export SVG to PPTX, which is a presentation format supported by Microsoft PowerPoint. Then, using Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to POTX. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, so you can get started right away. 

The process of converting SVG to POTX is simple and straightforward. All you need to do is install the Aspose.Total for C++ package, and you can begin exporting SVG to PPTX and converting PPTX to POTX. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can quickly and easily add SVG to POTX conversion to your C++ applications.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to POTX, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTX File via C++" %}}
After converting SVG to POTX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potx", SaveFormat::Potx);
```
