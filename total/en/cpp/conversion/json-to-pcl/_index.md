<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write. PCL (Printer Command Language) is a page description language used to control the printing of documents on a variety of printers and other output devices. It is a language that is used to control the printing of documents on a variety of printers and other output devices. Converting JSON to PCL is a useful way to ensure that the data stored in JSON is compatible with the PCL format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for json to pcl conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of components that enables developers to create applications that can parse JSON to PCL. It includes Aspose.Cells for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to export JSON to PDF and convert PDF to PCL respectively. The process of converting JSON to PCL is simple and straightforward. Firstly, Aspose.Cells for C++ can be used to export JSON to PDF. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ can be used to convert PDF to PCL. This makes it easy for developers to create applications that can parse JSON to PCL.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PDF using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to PCL format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout & Convert JSON Format to PCL in C++" %}}
While parsing JSON to PCL, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PCL with Watermark in C++" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to PCL with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PCL document, you can first convert JSON to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class, set different properties for text watermark,
call SetText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to PCL.
