<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is a process of transforming emails from one format to another. This process is necessary to ensure that emails can be read and used in different applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for eml to pdf conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you to convert emails from one format to another. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++. Aspose.Email for C++ can be used to convert EML file format to HTML. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ API can be used to export HTML to PDF. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. This package provides a comprehensive set of features to help you convert emails from one format to another. It also provides a wide range of features to help you manage and manipulate emails. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert emails from one format to another and ensure that emails can be read and used in different applications.

1. Open EML file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EML to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to PDF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Pdf as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load the EML file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.eml");
// save EML as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Pdf as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Pdf");

Not only you can convert your EML to PDF, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EML document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.eml");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EML to PDF. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Pdf");
```
