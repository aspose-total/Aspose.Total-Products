<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate PCL to PPS conversion feature inside your C++ applications. PCL (Printer Command Language) is a page description language used to control the printing process. PPS (PowerPoint Show) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. Converting PCL to PPS allows you to view the content of the PCL file in a more user-friendly format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to PPS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides a comprehensive set of features for developing C++ applications. It includes APIs for manipulating PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other file formats. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily export PCL to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, by using Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to PPS. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. Therefore, you can use Aspose.Total for C++ to integrate PCL to PPS conversion feature inside your C++ applications in two simple steps.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pps` as SaveFormat

```cpp

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.pcl");
// save PCL as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Pps format

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to PPS, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPS File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to PPS, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPS file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pps");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pps", SaveFormat::Pps);
