<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate PCL to PPSX conversion feature inside your C++ applications. PCL is a page description language developed by Hewlett-Packard and is used to generate documents for printing. PPSX is a Microsoft PowerPoint Open XML Presentation file format used to store slideshows. Converting PCL to PPSX allows you to view and edit the content of the PCL file in PowerPoint.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to PPSX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents, images, and presentations. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export PCL to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPSX respectively. 

The process of converting PCL to PPSX can be done in two simple steps. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export PCL to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and rendering PDF files. It also supports the conversion of PCL to PPTX.

Once you have exported the PCL file to PPTX, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to PPSX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PowerPoint documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and rendering presentations. It also supports the conversion of PPTX to PPSX.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily integrate PCL to PPSX conversion feature inside your C++ applications. It is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents, images, and presentations.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPSX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Ppsx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to PPSX, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPSX File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to PPSX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPSX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppsx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppsx", SaveFormat::Ppsx);
