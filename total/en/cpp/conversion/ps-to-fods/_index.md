<h2>Why to Convert PS to FODS</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents, but it is not suitable for editing. The Flat Open Document Spreadsheet (FODS) format is an open standard for spreadsheets, and it is a better choice for editing. Converting PDF to FODS allows users to edit the document in a spreadsheet program.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PS document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PS file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
