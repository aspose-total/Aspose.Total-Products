<h2>Why to Convert MD to OTP</h2>

C++ developers often need to integrate MD to OTP conversion feature inside their applications. This is because OTP is a more secure and reliable format for storing and sharing data. It is also easier to access and manage data stored in OTP format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to OTP Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily and quickly convert MD to OTP. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. 

Using Aspose.PDF for C++, developers can export MD to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and printing PDF documents. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP.

Once the MD is converted to PPTX, developers can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to OTP. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating presentations, such as creating, editing, converting, and printing presentations. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP.

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily and quickly convert MD to OTP. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. By using these two APIs, developers can export MD to PPTX and then convert PPTX to OTP in two simple steps. This makes it easier for developers to integrate MD to OTP conversion feature inside their C++ applications.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MD to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to OTP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Otp` as SaveFormat

// save MD as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Otp format

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to OTP, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in OTP File via C++" %}}
After converting MD to OTP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a OTP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a OTP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.otp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.otp", SaveFormat::Otp);
