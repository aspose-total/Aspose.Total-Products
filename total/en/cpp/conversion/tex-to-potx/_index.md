<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add a feature to your application that allows for the conversion of TEX to POTX, then you have come to the right place. TEX is a markup language used for typesetting documents, while POTX is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. Converting between the two formats can be a difficult task, but with the right tools, it can be done quickly and easily.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to POTX Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with the conversion of TEX to POTX. It includes two APIs that can be used to export TEX to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POTX. The first API is Aspose.PDF for C++, which can be used to export TEX to PPTX. The second API is Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to convert PPTX to POTX. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package, which makes it easy to access both APIs in one place. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert TEX to POTX in two simple steps. First, you can export TEX to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, you can convert PPTX to POTX by using Aspose.Slides for C++. This makes it easy to add the TEX to POTX conversion feature to your C++ applications.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of TEX Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering TEX to POTX, you can open a password protected TEX and also change its password. In order to change the password of a TEX file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing TEX Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.tex", L"owner");
// change password of TEX Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTX File via C++" %}}
After converting TEX to POTX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potx", SaveFormat::Potx);
```
