<h2>Why to Convert SVG to DOCM?</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web development and other graphic design applications. However, the DOCM file format is a Microsoft Word Open XML Macro-Enabled Document file, which is used to store documents with macros enabled. It is used to store documents with macros enabled, and it is the default file format for Microsoft Word 2007 and later versions. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to DOCM in order to use the document with macros enabled.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to DOCM Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert SVG to DOCM in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert SVG file format to DOC. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF documents to other file formats. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to DOCM. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate Word documents, including the ability to convert Word documents to other file formats. Moreover, Aspose.Total for C++ also provides other APIs such as Aspose.Cells for C++, Aspose.Slides for C++, Aspose.Email for C++, Aspose.BarCode for C++, Aspose.Imaging for C++, and Aspose.Tasks for C++, which can be used to automate various file format conversions.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to DOCM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to DOCM, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOCM File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict DOCM file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Docm");  
```
