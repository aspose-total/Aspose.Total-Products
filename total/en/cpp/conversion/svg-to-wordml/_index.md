<h2>Why to Convert SVG to WORDML</h2>

The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web development and other applications. On the other hand, WORDML is a markup language used to represent a Microsoft Word document. It is an XML-based format that is used to store and transport documents. Converting SVG to WORDML is beneficial for developers as it allows them to use the features of both formats.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to WORDML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert SVG to WORDML in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert SVG file format to DOC. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to WORDML. Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides a wide range of features for manipulating documents, images, and other file formats. It is a reliable and efficient solution for developers who need to convert SVG to WORDML.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to WORDML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to WORDML, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict WORDML File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict WORDML file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.WordML");  
```
