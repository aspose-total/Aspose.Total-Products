<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting OpenDocument Text (OTT) documents to Microsoft Excel (XLSX) format is a common requirement for many applications. OTT documents are widely used for creating and editing documents, and Excel is the most popular spreadsheet application. Converting OTT to Excel allows users to view, analyze, and manipulate the data in the document in a more efficient manner.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for OTT to Excel Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily create, manipulate, and convert documents in various formats. It includes two powerful APIs, Aspose.Words for C++ and Aspose.Cells for C++, which can be used to export OTT to HTML and then convert HTML to EXCEL respectively. Aspose.Words for C++ is a feature-rich, powerful, and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API that enables developers to export OTT documents to HTML format. Aspose.Cells for C++ is a powerful spreadsheet API that enables developers to convert HTML documents to EXCEL format. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package, which makes it easy for developers to include OTT to EXCEL conversion feature within their C++ applications.

[Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) also allows you to access document properties of OTT file and lets you take an informed decision before the conversion process. To access document properties you can use [BuiltInDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.built_in_document_properties) to obtain built-in properties and [CustomDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.custom_document_properties) to obtain custom properties. The following code example shows how to enumerate all built-in and custom properties in a document.
