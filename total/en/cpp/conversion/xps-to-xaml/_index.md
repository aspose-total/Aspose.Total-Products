<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer and looking to add XPS to XAML conversion feature inside your C++ applications, then you need to convert XPS to XAML. XPS is a fixed-layout document format that is used to store documents in a way that is independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system. XAML is a markup language used to define user interfaces in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for XPS to XAML conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides a wide range of features for C++ developers. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, Words, Cells, and Email. To convert XPS to XAML, you can use two APIs from Aspose.Total for C++. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export XPS to PPTX. Secondly, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to XAML. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. 

The process of XPS to XAML conversion is quite simple. First, you need to export XPS to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Then, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to XAML. Aspose.Total for C++ provides a comprehensive set of features for C++ developers to work with PDF, Slides, Words, Cells, and Email. It also provides the feature to convert XPS to XAML in two simple steps.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XPS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

```cpp

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.xps");
// save XPS as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Xaml format

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XPS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XPS to XAML, you can open a password protected XPS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XPS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XPS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xps", L"owner");
// change password of XPS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in XAML File via C++" %}}
After converting XPS to XAML, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a XAML file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.xaml");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.xaml", SaveFormat::Xaml);
