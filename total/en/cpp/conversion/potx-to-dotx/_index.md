[Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) is complete package of C++ File Format Automation libraries. By using the rich features of the APIs avaiable in the pacakge, we can easily convert PowerPoint POTX to Word DOTX. In order to perform the conversion, you can first use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) API to convert POTX to HTML. After that by using feature-rich Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) you can convert the HTML to DOTX.
