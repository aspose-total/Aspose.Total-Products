<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting a PowerPoint presentation to an Excel Add-in (.xlam) file can be beneficial in a variety of ways. It allows users to access the presentation from within Excel, making it easier to view and edit the content. Additionally, the .xlam file format is more secure than the .ppt format, as it is not as vulnerable to malicious attacks. 

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PPT to XLAM Conversion</h2>

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLAM without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
