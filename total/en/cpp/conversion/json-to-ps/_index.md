Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily parse JSON to PS within their C++ applications. This suite of APIs provides two simple steps to achieve this goal. 

The first step is to use Aspose.Cells for C++ to export JSON to PDF. This API provides a wide range of features that allow developers to manipulate and convert spreadsheets in various formats. It also enables developers to export JSON data to PDF format with ease. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Words for C++ to convert PDF to PS. This API provides a wide range of features that allow developers to manipulate and convert documents in various formats. It also enables developers to convert PDF documents to PS format with ease. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for C++ is a great suite of APIs that makes it easy for developers to parse JSON to PS within their C++ applications. It provides two simple steps to achieve this goal, which makes it a great choice for developers who need to quickly and easily convert JSON to PS.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PDF using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to PS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout & Convert JSON Format to PS in C++" %}}
While parsing JSON to PS, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collection’s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PS with Watermark in C++" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to PS with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PS document, you can first convert JSON to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class, set different properties for text watermark,
call SetText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to PS.
