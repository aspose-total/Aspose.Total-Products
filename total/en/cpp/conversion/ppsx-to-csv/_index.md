<h2>Why to Convert PPSX to CSV</h2>

The Portable Presentation Format (PPSX) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of the PowerPoint Presentation (PPT) file format and is used to store slideshows. It is a popular format for sharing presentations, as it is smaller in size than the original PPT file. However, the PPSX file format is not supported by many applications, and therefore, it is necessary to convert it to a more widely supported format such as CSV.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to CSV without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
