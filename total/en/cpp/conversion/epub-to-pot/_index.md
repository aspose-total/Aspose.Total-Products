<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer and looking to add the feature of EPUB to POT conversion inside your C++ applications, then you need to convert EPUB to POT. EPUB is a popular format for e-books and POT is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations. Converting EPUB to POT will help you to integrate the feature of EPUB to POT conversion inside your C++ applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for epub to pot conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a package that contains APIs for manipulating various file formats. It includes APIs for manipulating PDF, Slides, Words, Cells, and many other file formats. You can use Aspose.Total for C++ to convert EPUB to POT in two simple steps. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export EPUB to PPTX. Secondly, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to POT. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package. Thus, Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy to convert EPUB to POT in two simple steps.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pot` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load EPUB file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.epub");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Pot format
prs->Save(u"output.pot", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pot);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of EPUB Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering EPUB to POT, you can open a password protected EPUB and also change its password. In order to change the password of a EPUB file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing EPUB Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.epub", L"owner");
// change password of EPUB Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POT File via C++" %}}
After converting EPUB to POT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pot");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pot", SaveFormat::Pot);
