<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to ODP?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save web pages in a single file. It is a combination of HTML code and resources like images, audio, and video. ODP (OpenDocument Presentation) is a file format used to create presentations. It is an open standard for electronic documents and is used by many applications. Converting MHTML to ODP allows users to create presentations from web pages.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to ODP Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents in C++ applications. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, Words, and other file formats. It can be used to convert MHTML to ODP in two simple steps. First, you can export MHTML to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, by using Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to ODP. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. This makes it easy for developers to integrate MHTML to ODP conversion feature inside their C++ applications.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MHTML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to ODP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Odp` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load MHTML file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.mhtml");
// save MHTML as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Odp format
prs->Save(u"output.odp", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Odp);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to ODP, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in ODP File via C++" %}}
After converting MHTML to ODP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a ODP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a ODP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.odp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.odp", SaveFormat::Odp);
```
