<h2>Why to Convert PCL to POTX?</h2>

C++ developers often need to convert PCL to POTX in order to integrate the feature into their applications. PCL (Printer Command Language) is a page description language used to control printing devices. POTX (PowerPoint Open XML) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations. Converting PCL to POTX allows C++ developers to create presentations from PCL documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to POTX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables C++ developers to easily integrate PCL to POTX conversion into their applications. The suite includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.PDF for C++ allows developers to export PCL to PPTX, while Aspose.Slides for C++ enables them to convert PPTX to POTX. Both APIs are available as part of the Aspose.Total for C++ package. This makes it easy for developers to integrate PCL to POTX conversion into their applications without having to purchase and install multiple APIs.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to POTX, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTX File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to POTX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potx", SaveFormat::Potx);
