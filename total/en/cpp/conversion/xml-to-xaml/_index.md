<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate XML to XAML conversion feature inside your C++ applications. XAML is a markup language used to define user interfaces in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. It is a powerful language that allows developers to create visually stunning user interfaces. XML, on the other hand, is a markup language used to store and transport data. It is a popular choice for data storage and exchange. Converting XML to XAML can help you create visually appealing user interfaces for your applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to XAML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, and other file formats. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily export XML to PPTX and convert PPTX to XAML.

To export XML to PPTX, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++. It is a powerful API that allows you to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. With Aspose.PDF for C++, you can easily export XML to PPTX.

To convert PPTX to XAML, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++. It is a powerful API that allows you to create, edit, and convert presentations. With Aspose.Slides for C++, you can easily convert PPTX to XAML.

Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily export XML to PPTX and convert PPTX to XAML in two simple steps. It is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XML to XAML, you can open a password protected XML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xml", L"owner");
// change password of XML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in XAML File via C++" %}}
After converting XML to XAML, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a XAML file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a XAML file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.xaml");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.xaml", SaveFormat::Xaml);
