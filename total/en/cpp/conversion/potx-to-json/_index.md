<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store and share documents in a secure and reliable way. However, it is not suitable for data exchange and integration with other applications. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between applications. It is easy to read and write and is used for data exchange between web applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF files to JSON format for data exchange and integration with other applications.
