<h2>Why to Convert XPS to DIF?</h2>

XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a document format developed by Microsoft. It is used to store documents in a fixed layout format. It is similar to PDF but is not as widely used. DIF (Data Interchange Format) is a file format used to store tabular data. It is used to exchange data between different applications. Converting XPS to DIF is necessary when you need to exchange data between applications that do not support XPS.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for XPS to DIF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that enables developers to easily convert XPS to DIF in C++. It consists of three components: Aspose.PDF for C++, Aspose.Cells for C++, and Aspose.Total for C++. The process of converting XPS to DIF in C++ is a simple two-step process. 

In the first step, you can export XPS to XLSX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful library that enables developers to easily convert XPS to XLSX in C++. It supports a wide range of features such as text extraction, image extraction, and page manipulation. 

In the second step, you can convert XLSX to DIF by using Aspose.Cells for C++. Aspose.Cells for C++ is a powerful library that enables developers to easily convert XLSX to DIF in C++. It supports a wide range of features such as data manipulation, formatting, and charting. 

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily convert XPS to DIF in C++. It is a powerful suite of file format automation libraries that enables developers to easily convert XPS to DIF in C++.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set XPS File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XPS document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XPS file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save DIF File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving DIF file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
