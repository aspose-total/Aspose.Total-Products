[Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) consists of powerful file automation APIs that allows to automate OTT to PPTM conversion while using two of it's APIs. Load your OTT using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) and convert it to HTML, then load the HTML via PowerPoint manipulation C++ API [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to create a new presentation, and save it as PPTM.

1. Open OTT file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference
2. Convert OTT to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stdbasicostream_saveoptions) member function
3. Initialize a new [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) object
4. Add an AutoShape in your slide, and add AddTextFrame in it
5. Load the HTML content and write it in your Presentation file
6. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) method and set Pptm as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with C++ File Format APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/cpp).

// add TextFrame to the Rectangle
ashp->AddTextFrame(u" ");

// get Paragraphs collection
SharedPtr<Aspose::Slides::IParagraphCollection>ParaCollection = txtFrame->get_Paragraphs();

ParaCollection->Clear();
// load the HTML file using stream reader
SharedPtr<System::IO::StreamReader>  tr = MakeObject<System::IO::StreamReader>(HtmlOutput.HTML);
// add text from HTML stream reader in text frame
ParaCollection->AddFromHtml(tr->ReadToEnd());
// save presentation as Pptm
pres->Save(output.pptm, Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pptm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Load Password Protected OTT Document via C++" %}}
Apart from document conversion, [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API allows tons of document manipulation features for C++ developers. In case your Microsoft Word OTT file format is password protected, you can still open it using the API. In order to load the encrypted document, you can use a special constructor overload, which accepts a [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.loading.load_options) object. This object contains the Password property, which specifies the password string.  
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// when loading password protected document, the password is passed to the document's constructor using a LoadOptions object.
auto options = MakeObject<LoadOptions>(u"docPassword");
// load the document from the local file system by filename:
SharedPtr<Document> doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"Encrypted.ott", options);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Comments in PPTM Document via C++" %}}
While saving OTT as PPTM, you can also use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to add further features in your PPTM document. For instance, you can add comments in your presentation. The presentation slide comment are associated with a particular author. The Presentation class holds the collection of authors in ICommentAuthorCollection that are responsible for adding slide comments. For each author, there is a collection of comments in ICommentCollection.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate Presentation class
SharedPtr<Presentation>pres = MakeObject<Presentation>();
// access first slide
SharedPtr<ILayoutSlide>layout = pres->get_LayoutSlides()->idx_get(0);
// add empty slide
pres->get_Slides()->AddEmptySlide(layout);
// adding Author
SharedPtr<ICommentAuthor> author = pres->get_CommentAuthors()->AddAuthor(u"John Doe", u"MF");
// set position of comments
System::Drawing::PointF point = System::Drawing::PointF(0.2f, 0.2f);
// add slide comment for an author on slide 1
author->get_Comments()->AddComment(u"Hello John, this is a slide comment", pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(1), point, DateTime::get_Now());
// access ISlide 1
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// save presentation as Pptm
pres->Save(output.pptm, Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pptm);
