<h2>Why to Convert PS to POTM?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer, you may need to integrate the feature of PS to POTM conversion inside your C++ applications. PS (PostScript) is a page description language used for printing documents, while POTM (PowerPoint Open XML Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a file format used to save presentations in Microsoft PowerPoint. Converting PS to POTM can help you to create presentations with macros and other features that are not available in PS.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to POTM Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that can help you to convert PS to POTM in two simple steps. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ to export PS to PPTX. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful PDF manipulation API that can help you to convert PDF documents to other file formats, including PPTX. Secondly, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to POTM. Aspose.Slides for C++ is a powerful presentation manipulation API that can help you to convert presentations to other file formats, including POTM. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package, which is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you to manipulate documents, presentations, and images.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load PS file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.ps");
// save PS as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Potm format
prs->Save(u"output.potm", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Potm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PS to POTM, you can open a password protected PS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.ps", L"owner");
// change password of PS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTM File via C++" %}}
After converting PS to POTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potm", SaveFormat::Potm);
