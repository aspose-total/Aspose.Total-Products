<h2>Why to Convert PCL to PPT?</h2>

C++ developers often need to convert PCL (Printer Command Language) to PPT (PowerPoint Presentation) format in order to integrate PCL to PPT conversion feature inside their C++ applications. PCL is a page description language used to control printers and is used to create documents such as reports, labels, and invoices. PPT is a popular file format used to create presentations and slideshows. Converting PCL to PPT allows users to view and edit PCL documents in a more user-friendly format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to PPT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export PCL to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPT respectively. Both APIs are easy to use and can be integrated into C++ applications with minimal effort. The APIs provide a wide range of features and support for various file formats, making them ideal for PCL to PPT conversion. Furthermore, Aspose.Total for C++ is available as a single package, making it easier and more cost-effective for developers to access all the APIs.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Ppt` as SaveFormat

```cpp

// save PCL as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Ppt format

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to PPT, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPT File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to PPT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppt");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppt", SaveFormat::Ppt);
