<h2>Why to Convert MD to SWF?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add a feature to your applications that allows for MD to SWF conversion, then you have come to the right place. SWF is a file format used for multimedia, vector graphics, and ActionScript. It is used to display animation and interactive applications on the web. SWF files are often used for creating games, interactive videos, and other web-based applications. Converting MD to SWF allows you to take advantage of the features of SWF and create a more engaging experience for your users.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to SWF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with your MD to SWF conversion needs. It includes two APIs that can help you with the conversion process. The first API is Aspose.PDF for C++, which can help you export MD to PPTX. The second API is Aspose.Slides for C++, which can help you convert PPTX to SWF. Both of these APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy to get started with your MD to SWF conversion project.

Using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert MD to SWF in two simple steps. First, you can export MD to PPTX using Aspose.PDF for C++. Then, you can convert PPTX to SWF using Aspose.Slides for C++. This makes it easy to add MD to SWF conversion features to your C++ applications. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can quickly and easily add MD to SWF conversion features to your applications.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MD to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to SWF, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in SWF File via C++" %}}
After converting MD to SWF, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a SWF file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.swf");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.swf", SaveFormat::Swf);
