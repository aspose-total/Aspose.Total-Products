 You can include WORDML to TSV conversion feature within your C++ applications easily. By using feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/), you can export WORDML to HTML. After that, by using [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/), you can convert HTML to TSV. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) package.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Access WORDML Document Properties via C++" %}}
[Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) also allows you to access document properties of WORDML file and lets you take an informed decision before the conversion process. To access document properties you can use [BuiltInDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.built_in_document_properties) to obtain built-in properties and [CustomDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.custom_document_properties) to obtain custom properties. The following code example shows how to enumerate all built-in and custom properties in a document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save TSV File to Stream via C++" %}}
After converting WORDML to TSV, [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/) enables you to save your document to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method.

                          <span itemprop="text">To use the above WORDML to TSV converter, simply follow these easy steps. First, add your WORDML file to the converter by either dragging and dropping the file into the white area or clicking inside the area to import the document. Next, click the "Convert" button to initiate the conversion process.<br />

Once the WORDML to TSV conversion is complete, you'll be able to download your converted file instantly with just one click. This makes it incredibly easy to convert your WORDML files to TSV format, and you can do it all without having to install any additional software or plugins.</span>

                          <span itemprop="text">When it comes to using the WORDML to TSV converter, the speed of the conversion process will depend largely on the size of your WORDML file. For smaller files, the conversion can be completed in just a few seconds, making it incredibly fast and efficient. However, larger files may take a bit longer to convert.<br />

If you're planning to integrate the WORDML to TSV conversion code into your C++ application, the speed and efficiency of the conversion process will also depend on how well you've optimized your application. By ensuring that your application is optimized for the conversion process, you can help ensure that your WORDML files are converted to TSV format quickly and accurately.</span>
