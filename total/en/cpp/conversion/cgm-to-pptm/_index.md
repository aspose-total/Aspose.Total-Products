<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate CGM to PPTM conversion feature inside your C++ applications. CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format, while PPTM (PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a presentation format. Converting CGM to PPTM allows you to create presentations with vector graphics, which can be edited and manipulated in PowerPoint.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to PPTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides a comprehensive set of features for C++ developers. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export CGM to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPTM respectively.

To export CGM to PPTX, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++. This API provides a wide range of features for working with PDF documents, including the ability to convert CGM to PPTX. It also supports a variety of other formats, such as HTML, XPS, SVG, and more.

Once you have exported CGM to PPTX, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to PPTM. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with PowerPoint presentations, including the ability to convert PPTX to PPTM. It also supports a variety of other formats, such as PDF, HTML, XPS, and more.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily integrate CGM to PPTM conversion feature inside your C++ applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to export CGM to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPTM. Moreover, it also supports a variety of other formats, making it a great choice for C++ developers.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert CGM to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pptm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of CGM Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering CGM to PPTM, you can open a password protected CGM and also change its password. In order to change the password of a CGM file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing CGM Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.cgm", L"owner");
// change password of CGM Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPTM File via C++" %}}
After converting CGM to PPTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pptm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pptm", SaveFormat::Pptm);
