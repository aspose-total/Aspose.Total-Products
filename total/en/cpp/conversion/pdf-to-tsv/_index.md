<h2>Why to Convert PDF to TSV?</h2>

PDF is a popular file format for sharing documents, but it is not suitable for data analysis and manipulation. TSV (Tab Separated Values) is a text-based format that is used to store tabular data. It is a simple and efficient way to store data in a structured format, which makes it ideal for data analysis and manipulation. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PDF to TSV in order to make the data more accessible and easier to work with.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PDF document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PDF file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
