<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is a process of transforming emails from one format to another. For example, you may need to convert an EMLX file format to HTML.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for emlx to image conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that helps developers to work with various file formats. It includes Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++. Aspose.Email for C++ API helps to convert EMLX file format to HTML. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ API can be used to export HTML to IMAGE. This way, Aspose.Total for C++ helps developers to convert EMLX file format to IMAGE.

1. Open EMLX file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMLX to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to PNG format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Png as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EMLX file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.emlx");
// save EMLX as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Png as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Png");

Not only you can convert your EMLX to IMAGE, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMLX document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.emlx");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMLX to IMAGE. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Png");
