<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate the feature of EPUB to POTM conversion in your applications. This conversion is necessary to make the content of EPUB files compatible with the POTM format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to POTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that helps developers to easily integrate features like EPUB to POTM conversion in their C++ applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export EPUB to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POTM respectively. 

The Aspose.PDF for C++ API allows developers to export EPUB files to PPTX format. It supports all the features of EPUB files, including text, images, tables, hyperlinks, etc. It also provides the ability to convert EPUB files to other popular formats like PDF, HTML, XPS, etc.

The Aspose.Slides for C++ API helps developers to convert PPTX files to POTM format. It supports all the features of PPTX files, including text, images, tables, animations, etc. It also provides the ability to convert PPTX files to other popular formats like PDF, HTML, XPS, etc.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate the feature of EPUB to POTM conversion in their C++ applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to export EPUB to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POTM.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Potm` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load EPUB file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.epub");
// save EPUB as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Potm format
prs->Save(u"output.potm", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Potm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of EPUB Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering EPUB to POTM, you can open a password protected EPUB and also change its password. In order to change the password of a EPUB file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing EPUB Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.epub", L"owner");
// change password of EPUB Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTM File via C++" %}}
After converting EPUB to POTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potm", SaveFormat::Potm);
