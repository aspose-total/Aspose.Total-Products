<h2>Why to Convert JSON to POT</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is easy for humans to read and write. On the other hand, POT (Presentation Template) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store slide designs. It is used to create a consistent look and feel for all slides in a presentation. Therefore, it is important to convert JSON to POT in order to create a professional-looking presentation.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to POT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents, images, and other file formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Cells for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to convert JSON to POT. 

Using Aspose.Cells for C++, developers can parse JSON to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, and converting spreadsheets. It also supports a variety of file formats including XLSX, XLS, ODS, CSV, and HTML.

Aspose.Slides for C++ can be used to convert PPTX to POT. This API provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, and converting presentations. It also supports a variety of file formats including PPTX, PPT, PPSX, PPS, ODP, and PDF.

Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package. This package provides a comprehensive set of APIs that can be used to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents, images, and other file formats. It also includes a number of other APIs such as Aspose.Words for C++, Aspose.PDF for C++, and Aspose.Imaging for C++. 

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for C++ is an ideal solution for converting JSON to POT. It provides two APIs, Aspose.Cells for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to parse JSON to PPTX and convert PPTX to POT respectively.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) method

While parsing JSON to POT, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to POT with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POT document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class, get the first slide, Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type, add TextFrame to the Rectangle, create the Paragraph object for a text frame, create Portion object for paragraph, add watermark using set_Text() and, can save the document to POT.
