<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Are you a C++ developer looking to add a feature to integrate PS to SWF conversion inside your C++ applications? PS to SWF conversion is a useful feature for C++ developers as it allows them to create interactive presentations and animations. It also allows them to create high-quality vector graphics and animations for their applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PS to SWF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, and other file formats. With Aspose.Total, developers can easily export PS to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Then, they can convert PPTX to SWF by using Aspose.Slides for C++. Both APIs come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy for developers to access the features they need.

The Aspose.Total for C++ package is a great solution for C++ developers who need to add PS to SWF conversion features to their applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface that makes it simple to export PS to PPTX and then convert PPTX to SWF. With Aspose.Total, developers can quickly and easily add the features they need to their applications.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

```cpp

doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Swf format

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PS to SWF, you can open a password protected PS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.ps", L"owner");
// change password of PS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in SWF File via C++" %}}
After converting PS to SWF, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a SWF file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.swf");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.swf", SaveFormat::Swf);
```
