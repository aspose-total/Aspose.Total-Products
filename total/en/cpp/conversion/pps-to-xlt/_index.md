<h2>Why to Convert PPS to XLT?</h2>

The Portable Presentation Format (PPS) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of the PowerPoint Presentation (PPT) file format. The PPS file format is used to store presentations that are opened and viewed in the PowerPoint Viewer. On the other hand, the Excel Template (XLT) file format is used to store a template for an Excel spreadsheet. XLT files are used to create a new spreadsheet with the same formatting and formulas as the template. Converting PPS to XLT allows users to create a spreadsheet with the same formatting and formulas as the PPS file.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLT without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
