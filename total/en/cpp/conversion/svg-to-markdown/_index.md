<h2>Why to Convert SVG to Markdown</h2>

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents. It is widely used for writing on the web, and is the preferred format for many online forums and blogs. It is also used for creating rich text documents, such as those used in Microsoft Word. Converting SVG to Markdown allows users to easily create and share documents that are both visually appealing and easy to read.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to Markdown Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive file format automation library that enables C++ developers to easily convert SVG to MARKDOWN in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert SVG file format to DOC. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to MARKDOWN. Aspose.Total for C++ is a powerful and reliable library that provides a comprehensive set of APIs for manipulating a wide range of file formats, including SVG, DOC, and MARKDOWN. It is easy to use and provides a simple and efficient way to convert SVG to MARKDOWN.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to MARKDOWN format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to MARKDOWN, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict MARKDOWN File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict MARKDOWN file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Markdown");  
```
