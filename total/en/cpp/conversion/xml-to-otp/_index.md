<h2>Why to Convert XML to OTP?</h2>

XML to OTP conversion is a useful feature for C++ developers who want to add extra functionality to their applications. OTP (One-Time Password) is a secure authentication method used to protect user accounts from unauthorized access. It is a unique code that is generated for a single use and expires after a certain amount of time. By converting XML to OTP, developers can ensure that their applications are secure and user accounts are protected.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to OTP Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert XML to OTP: Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. With Aspose.PDF for C++, developers can export XML to PPTX. Then, with Aspose.Slides for C++, they can convert PPTX to OTP. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy for developers to add XML to OTP conversion feature to their C++ applications.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to OTP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Otp` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XML to OTP, you can open a password protected XML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xml", L"owner");
// change password of XML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in OTP File via C++" %}}
After converting XML to OTP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a OTP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a OTP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.otp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.otp", SaveFormat::Otp);
