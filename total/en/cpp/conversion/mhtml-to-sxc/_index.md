<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to SXC?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save web pages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources such as images, audio, and video. SXC (StarOffice Calc) is a spreadsheet file format used by the StarOffice and OpenOffice.org applications. It is a compressed version of the OpenDocument Spreadsheet format and is used to store data in a tabular form. Converting MHTML to SXC is beneficial for users who need to store and manipulate data in a spreadsheet format.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MHTML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MHTML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
