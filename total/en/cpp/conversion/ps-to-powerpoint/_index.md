{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PS to POWERPOINT, you can open a password protected PS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.ps", L"owner");
// change password of PS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POWERPOINT File via C++" %}}
After converting PS to POWERPOINT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POWERPOINT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POWERPOINT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.powerpoint");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.powerpoint", SaveFormat::Ppt);
