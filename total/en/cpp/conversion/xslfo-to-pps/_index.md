<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate XSLFO to PPS conversion feature inside your C++ applications. XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML-based markup language for formatting documents. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting information. PPS (PowerPoint Show) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store presentations. It is a self-running presentation that can be opened without PowerPoint.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for XSLFO to PPS Conversion</h2>

You can easily convert XSLFO to PPS by using Aspose.Total for C++. It is a suite of APIs that provides a comprehensive set of file processing features. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.PDF for C++ can be used to export XSLFO to PPTX. Aspose.Slides for C++ can be used to convert PPTX to PPS. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. It is a single package that provides access to all the APIs of Aspose.Total for C++. It is a cost-effective solution that can be used to convert XSLFO to PPS in two simple steps.

// save XSLFO as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XSLFO Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XSLFO to PPS, you can open a password protected XSLFO and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XSLFO file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XSLFO Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xslfo", L"owner");
// change password of XSLFO Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPS File via C++" %}}
After converting XSLFO to PPS, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPS file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pps");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pps", SaveFormat::Pps);
