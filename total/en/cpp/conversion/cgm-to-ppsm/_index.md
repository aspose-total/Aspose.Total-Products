<h2>Why to Convert CGM to PPSM?</h2>

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a vector graphics format used for storing 2D and 3D drawings. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields. PPSM (PowerPoint Slide Show) is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is used to store slides and other presentation related information. Converting CGM to PPSM is beneficial for C++ developers as it allows them to integrate CGM to PPSM conversion feature inside their C++ applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to PPSM Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert and render various file formats. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. By using Aspose.PDF for C++, developers can export CGM to PPTX. And by using Aspose.Slides for C++, developers can convert PPTX to PPSM. This way, developers can easily integrate CGM to PPSM conversion feature inside their C++ applications in two simple steps.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert CGM to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPSM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Ppsm` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load CGM file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.cgm");
// save CGM as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Ppsm format
prs->Save(u"output.ppsm", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Ppsm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of CGM Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering CGM to PPSM, you can open a password protected CGM and also change its password. In order to change the password of a CGM file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing CGM Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.cgm", L"owner");
// change password of CGM Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPSM File via C++" %}}
After converting CGM to PPSM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPSM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPSM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppsm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppsm", SaveFormat::Ppsm);
