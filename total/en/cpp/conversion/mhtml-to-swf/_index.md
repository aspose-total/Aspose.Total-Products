<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to SWF?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add a feature to your applications that allows for the conversion of MHTML to SWF, then you have come to the right place. MHTML is a web page archive format that is used to store web pages and their associated resources. SWF is a vector-based file format used for multimedia, vector graphics, and ActionScript. Converting MHTML to SWF can be useful for creating interactive multimedia presentations, animations, and other interactive content.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to SWF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you with your MHTML to SWF conversion needs. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export MHTML to PPTX and then convert PPTX to SWF. To export MHTML to PPTX, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++. This API allows you to convert MHTML to PPTX with just a few lines of code. Once you have the PPTX file, you can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert it to SWF. This API provides a wide range of features that can help you create high-quality SWF files from PPTX. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily and quickly convert MHTML to SWF.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to SWF, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in SWF File via C++" %}}
After converting MHTML to SWF, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a SWF file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.swf");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.swf", SaveFormat::Swf);
```
