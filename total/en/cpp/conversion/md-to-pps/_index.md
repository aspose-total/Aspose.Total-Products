<h2>Why to Convert MD to PPS</h2>

C++ developers often need to integrate MD to PPS conversion feature inside their applications. MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents. It is used to create webpages, documents, and other forms of text documents. PPS (PowerPoint Show) is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is used to create slideshows and presentations. Converting MD to PPS allows users to create presentations from Markdown documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to PPS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, and Words. Aspose.PDF for C++ can be used to export MD to PPTX. Aspose.Slides for C++ can be used to convert PPTX to PPS. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate MD to PPS conversion feature inside their C++ applications. The APIs are easy to use and provide a wide range of features. They are also highly reliable and secure. Aspose.Total for C++ is a great choice for developers who need to add MD to PPS conversion feature inside their applications.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MD to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pps` as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load MD file with an instance of Document class
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.md");
// save MD as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Pps format
prs->Save(u"output.pps", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pps);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to PPS, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPS File via C++" %}}
After converting MD to PPS, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPS file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pps");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pps", SaveFormat::Pps);
