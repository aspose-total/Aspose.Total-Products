<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is important for many reasons, such as to make the emails easier to read, to make them more compatible with other applications, and to make them easier to store and share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to DOT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create powerful applications. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert emails to HTML and then export HTML to DOT. 

The first API is Aspose.Email for C++, which can be used to convert EMAIL file format to HTML. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write emails in various formats, the ability to convert emails to HTML, and the ability to extract attachments from emails.

The second API is Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to export HTML to DOT. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write documents in various formats, the ability to convert documents to HTML, and the ability to export documents to DOT.

By using these two APIs, developers can easily convert emails to HTML and then export HTML to DOT. This makes it easy to add email conversion features to applications, and it also makes it easier to store and share emails.

1. Open EMAIL file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMAIL to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to DOT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Dot as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with C++ File Format APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EMAIL file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save EMAIL as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Dot as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Dot");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EMAIL File via C++" %}}
Not only you can convert your EMAIL to DOT, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMAIL document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMAIL to DOT. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Dot");
```
