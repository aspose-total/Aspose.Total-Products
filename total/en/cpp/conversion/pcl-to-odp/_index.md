If you are a C++ developer looking to add the ability to convert PCL to ODP inside your C++ applications, you can do it in two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful API that enables you to export PCL to PPTX. Aspose.Slides for C++ is another API that can be used to convert PPTX to ODP. Both of these APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for C++ package.

Aspose.PDF for C++ is a feature-rich API that allows you to easily export PCL to PPTX. It supports a wide range of features such as text extraction, image extraction, page manipulation, and more. It also supports a variety of file formats such as PDF, XPS, PCL, and more. With Aspose.PDF for C++, you can easily export PCL to PPTX in just a few lines of code.

Aspose.Slides for C++ is a powerful API that enables you to convert PPTX to ODP. It supports a wide range of features such as text formatting, image manipulation, slide transitions, and more. It also supports a variety of file formats such as PPTX, ODP, PPT, and more. With Aspose.Slides for C++, you can easily convert PPTX to ODP in just a few lines of code.

Both Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++ are part of the Aspose.Total for C++ package. This package includes all the APIs from the Aspose family of products, including Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily add the ability to convert PCL to ODP inside your C++ applications.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert PCL to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to ODP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Odp` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to ODP, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in ODP File via C++" %}}
After converting PCL to ODP, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a ODP file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a ODP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.odp");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.odp", SaveFormat::Odp);
```
