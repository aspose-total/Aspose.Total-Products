<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Are you a C++ developer looking to add a feature to integrate XSLFO to POT conversion inside your C++ applications? XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML document formatting which is most commonly used to generate PDF documents. POT (PowerPoint Template) is a template file used to create a new PowerPoint presentation. Converting XSLFO to POT can be beneficial for C++ developers as it allows them to create a PowerPoint presentation from an XML document.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XSLFO to POT Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate and convert various file formats. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++ which can be used to convert XSLFO to POT. By using Aspose.PDF for C++, you can export XSLFO to PPTX and then by using Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to POT. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package.

The process of converting XSLFO to POT is quite simple and can be done in two steps. First, you can export XSLFO to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, you can convert PPTX to POT by using Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.Total for C++ provides a comprehensive set of APIs that can be used to manipulate and convert various file formats. It is a great tool for C++ developers who are looking to add a feature to integrate XSLFO to POT conversion inside their applications.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to POT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pot` as SaveFormat

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"template.xslfo");
// save XSLFO as PPTX format 
doc->Save(u"PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
SharedPtr<Presentation> prs = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PptxOutput.pptx");
// save the presentation as Pot format

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XSLFO Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XSLFO to POT, you can open a password protected XSLFO and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XSLFO file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XSLFO Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xslfo", L"owner");
// change password of XSLFO Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POT File via C++" %}}
After converting XSLFO to POT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pot");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pot", SaveFormat::Pot);
