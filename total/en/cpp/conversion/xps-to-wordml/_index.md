<h2>Why to Convert XPS to WORDML</h2>

XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a document format developed by Microsoft for printing and viewing documents. It is a fixed-layout document format that preserves document formatting and enables file sharing. WORDML (WordprocessingML) is an XML-based format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a markup language that is used to store and transport documents. Converting XPS to WORDML is beneficial as it allows users to open, edit, and share documents in the WORDML format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XPS to WORDML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to convert XPS to WORDML in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert XPS file format to DOC. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also allows developers to convert PDF to other popular file formats such as DOC, HTML, XPS, and more.

Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to WORDML. Aspose.Words for C++ is a powerful Word document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert Word documents. It also allows developers to convert Word documents to other popular file formats such as HTML, XPS, and more. With Aspose.Words for C++, developers can easily convert DOC to WORDML.

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to convert XPS to WORDML in two simple steps. Aspose.PDF for C++ API is used to convert XPS file format to DOC, and Aspose.Words for C++ is used to export DOC to WORDML. Converting XPS to WORDML is beneficial as it allows users to open, edit, and share documents in the WORDML format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XPS Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XPS to WORDML, you can open a password protected XPS and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XPS file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XPS Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xps", L"owner");
// change password of XPS Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict WORDML File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict WORDML file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.WordML");  
```
