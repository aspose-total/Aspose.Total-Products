<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer, you may need to integrate XML to SWF conversion feature inside your C++ applications. SWF is a popular format for displaying vector graphics and animations on the web. It is widely used for creating interactive web content, such as games, presentations, and other multimedia applications. XML is a markup language used to store and transport data. Converting XML to SWF can help you create interactive web content with ease.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to SWF Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you convert XML to SWF. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XML to SWF, you can open a password protected XML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xml", L"owner");
// change password of XML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in SWF File via C++" %}}
After converting XML to SWF, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a SWF file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.swf");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.swf", SaveFormat::Swf);
