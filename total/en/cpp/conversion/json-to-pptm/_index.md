<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format and is easy for humans to read and write. On the other hand, PPTM (PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a binary file format and is used to store PowerPoint presentations that contain macros. Therefore, it is necessary to convert JSON to PPTM in order to use the data stored in JSON format in a PowerPoint presentation.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) method

While parsing JSON to PPTM, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPTM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPTM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class, get the first slide, Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type, add TextFrame to the Rectangle, create the Paragraph object for a text frame, create Portion object for paragraph, add watermark using set_Text() and, can save the document to PPTM.
