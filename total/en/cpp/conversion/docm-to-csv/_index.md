 You can include DOCM to CSV conversion feature within your C++ applications easily. By using feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/), you can export DOCM to HTML. After that, by using [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/), you can convert HTML to CSV. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) package.

1. Open DOCM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference
2. Convert DOCM to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) member function
3. Load HTML document by using [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class reference
4. Save the document to CSV format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a5dc7de23f7ceba76a05dc1d49f51502e) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Access DOCM Document Properties via C++" %}}
[Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) also allows you to access document properties of DOCM file and lets you take an informed decision before the conversion process. To access document properties you can use [BuiltInDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.built_in_document_properties) to obtain built-in properties and [CustomDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.custom_document_properties) to obtain custom properties. The following code example shows how to enumerate all built-in and custom properties in a document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save CSV File to Stream via C++" %}}
After converting DOCM to CSV, [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/) enables you to save your document to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method.
