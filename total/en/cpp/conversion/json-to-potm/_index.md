<h2>Why to Convert JSON to POTM</h2>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format and is easy to read and write. POTM (PowerPoint Open XML Macro-Enabled Presentation) is a file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a macro-enabled version of the PPTX file format and is used to store presentations that contain macros. Converting JSON to POTM is useful for creating presentations with macros from JSON data.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for JSON to POTM Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents within any C++ application. It includes APIs for manipulating documents of various formats, including JSON, PPTX, and POTM. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert JSON to POTM within any C++ application in two simple steps. 

Firstly, by using Aspose.Cells for C++, you can parse JSON to PPTX. Aspose.Cells for C++ is a powerful spreadsheet processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render spreadsheets within any C++ application. It supports a wide range of spreadsheet formats, including JSON, and can be used to convert JSON to PPTX.

After that, by using Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to POTM. Aspose.Slides for C++ is a powerful presentation processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render presentations within any C++ application. It supports a wide range of presentation formats, including PPTX and POTM, and can be used to convert PPTX to POTM.

Both Aspose.Cells for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++ come under the Aspose.Total for C++ package. Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render documents within any C++ application. It includes APIs for manipulating documents of various formats, including JSON, PPTX, and POTM. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert JSON to POTM within any C++ application in two simple steps.

1. Create a new [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Save JSON as PPTX using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a9460f52a2dec8f4bf623a4905167d997) method
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) method

While parsing JSON to POTM, you can also set the size of rows and columns by loading JSON with [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) class. If you need to set the same row height for all rows in the worksheet, you can do it by using the [SetStandardHeight](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a0b79a3163e2b601aa1b6a6a1e3f1467f) method of the [ICells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell) collection. Similarly, to set the same column width for all columns in the worksheet, use the ICells collectionâ€™s [SetStandardWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_cell#a48f5dbccc3bf4bb9e6e882094b500bd7) method.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to POTM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POTM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class, get the first slide, Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type, add TextFrame to the Rectangle, create the Paragraph object for a text frame, create Portion object for paragraph, add watermark using set_Text() and, can save the document to POTM.
