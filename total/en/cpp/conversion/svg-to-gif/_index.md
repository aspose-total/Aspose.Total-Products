Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive file format automation library that enables C++ developers to easily convert SVG to GIF in two simple steps. The first step involves using the Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert SVG files to DOC. This API provides a wide range of features such as the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF documents, as well as the ability to extract text, images, and other content from PDF documents. The second step involves using the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, to export the DOC file to GIF. This API provides a range of features such as the ability to create, edit, and convert Word documents, as well as the ability to insert, delete, and manipulate text, images, and other content within Word documents. With Aspose.Total for C++, C++ developers can quickly and easily convert SVG to GIF with just two simple steps.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to GIF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with C++ File Automation APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

// save SVG as a DOC 
doc->Save(u"DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat::Doc); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> wordDoc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"DocOutput.doc");
// save document as Gif
wordDoc->Save(u"output.Gif");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to GIF, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict GIF File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict GIF file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Gif");  
```
