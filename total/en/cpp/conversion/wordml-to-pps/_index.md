{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Load Password Protected WORDML Document via C++" %}}
Apart from document conversion, [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API allows tons of document manipulation features for C++ developers. In case your Microsoft Word WORDML file format is password protected, you can still open it using the API. In order to load the encrypted document, you can use a special constructor overload, which accepts a [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.loading.load_options) object. This object contains the Password property, which specifies the password string.  
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// when loading password protected document, the password is passed to the document's constructor using a LoadOptions object.
auto options = MakeObject<LoadOptions>(u"docPassword");
// load the document from the local file system by filename:
SharedPtr<Document> doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"Encrypted.wordml", options);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Comments in PPS Document via C++" %}}
While saving WORDML as PPS, you can also use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to add further features in your PPS document. For instance, you can add comments in your presentation. The presentation slide comment are associated with a particular author. The Presentation class holds the collection of authors in ICommentAuthorCollection that are responsible for adding slide comments. For each author, there is a collection of comments in ICommentCollection.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate Presentation class
SharedPtr<Presentation>pres = MakeObject<Presentation>();
// access first slide
SharedPtr<ILayoutSlide>layout = pres->get_LayoutSlides()->idx_get(0);
// add empty slide
pres->get_Slides()->AddEmptySlide(layout);
// adding Author
SharedPtr<ICommentAuthor> author = pres->get_CommentAuthors()->AddAuthor(u"John Doe", u"MF");
// set position of comments
System::Drawing::PointF point = System::Drawing::PointF(0.2f, 0.2f);
// add slide comment for an author on slide 1
author->get_Comments()->AddComment(u"Hello John, this is a slide comment", pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(1), point, DateTime::get_Now());
// access ISlide 1
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// save presentation as Pps
pres->Save(output.pps, Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pps);
