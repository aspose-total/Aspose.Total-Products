<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The DOCM file format is a Microsoft Office Open XML format used by Microsoft Word. It is a macro-enabled document format that allows users to store Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code within the document. However, the DIF (Data Interchange Format) is a text-based file format used to store tabular data. It is used to transfer data between different applications. Therefore, if you want to transfer data from a DOCM file to a DIF file, you need to convert the DOCM file to HTML and then convert the HTML file to DIF.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Access DOCM Document Properties via C++" %}}
[Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) also allows you to access document properties of DOCM file and lets you take an informed decision before the conversion process. To access document properties you can use [BuiltInDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.built_in_document_properties) to obtain built-in properties and [CustomDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.custom_document_properties) to obtain custom properties. The following code example shows how to enumerate all built-in and custom properties in a document.
