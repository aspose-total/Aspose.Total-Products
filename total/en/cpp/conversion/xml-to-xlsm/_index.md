<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a popular data format used for storing and exchanging data. It is a text-based format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. However, it is not suitable for data analysis and manipulation. XLSM (Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook) is a Microsoft Excel file format that allows users to store macros, scripts, and other types of programming code. It is a more powerful and versatile format than XML, and is better suited for data analysis and manipulation. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert XML to XLSM.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
