<h2>Why to Convert PS to SXC</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system. However, the PDF format is not suitable for editing or manipulating data. Therefore, it is necessary to convert PDF documents to other formats such as SXC, which is a spreadsheet format used by Microsoft Excel.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your PS document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a PS file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
