<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is a process of transforming emails from one format to another. For example, you may need to convert an EML file format to HTML.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for eml to gif conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you to easily and quickly add email conversion features to your applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++. Aspose.Email for C++ API can be used to convert EML file format to HTML. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ API can be used to export HTML to GIF. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. This package provides a wide range of features that can help you to easily and quickly add email conversion features to your applications.

1. Open EML file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EML to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to GIF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Gif as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EML file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.eml");
// save EML as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Gif as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Gif");

Not only you can convert your EML to GIF, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EML document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.eml");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());
```

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EML to GIF. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Gif");
```
