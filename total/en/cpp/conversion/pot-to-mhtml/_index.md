<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. It is used to store documents in a format that is independent of the application used to create them. However, it is not always the best format for sharing documents. For example, when sharing documents with other users, it is often more convenient to use the MHTML format. MHTML is a web page format that allows documents to be viewed in a web browser.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input POT document is password protected, you cannot convert it to MHTML without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
