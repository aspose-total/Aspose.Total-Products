<h2>Why to Convert PPSM to MHTML</h2>

The Portable Slide Show (PPSM) format is a presentation format used by Microsoft PowerPoint. It is used to store slideshows and presentations. The MHTML format is a web page archive format used to store web pages and associated resources in a single file. It is used to store web pages and other web-based documents. Converting PPSM to MHTML allows users to view their presentations in a web browser, making them more accessible and easier to share.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PPSM to MHTML Conversion</h2>

Using Aspose.Slides for C++, developers can export PPSM to HTML. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write PPSM files, convert PPSM to other formats, and export slides to HTML.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to MHTML without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
