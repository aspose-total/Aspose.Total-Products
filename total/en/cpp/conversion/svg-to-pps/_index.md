<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to integrate SVG to PPS conversion feature inside your C++ applications. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. PPS (PowerPoint Slide Show) is a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation file format that supports animation, slide transitions, custom shapes, and more. Converting SVG to PPS can help you to create presentations with interactive elements and animations.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for svg to pps conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of all the C++ APIs offered by Aspose. It includes APIs for manipulating and converting various file formats, such as PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily export SVG to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++ and then convert PPTX to PPS by using Aspose.Slides for C++. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package.

The process of converting SVG to PPS is simple and straightforward. First, you need to export SVG to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and printing. It also supports converting SVG to PPTX. Once you have exported SVG to PPTX, you can then use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to PPS. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PowerPoint presentations, such as creating, editing, converting, and printing. It also supports converting PPTX to PPS.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily integrate SVG to PPS conversion feature inside your C++ applications. It is a comprehensive package of all the C++ APIs offered by Aspose, which makes it easy to export SVG to PPTX and then convert PPTX to PPS.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to PPS, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPS File via C++" %}}
After converting SVG to PPS, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPS file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pps");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pps", SaveFormat::Pps);
