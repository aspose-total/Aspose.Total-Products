<h2>Why to Convert SVG to XLTX?</h2>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. It is widely used for web graphics, and is supported by all modern web browsers. On the other hand, XLTX is a file format used by Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet application, for saving spreadsheets. XLTX is an XML-based file format, and is the default format used by Excel 2007 and later versions. Converting SVG to XLTX is useful for creating spreadsheets from vector images, and for making the images compatible with Excel.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set SVG File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your SVG document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a SVG file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
