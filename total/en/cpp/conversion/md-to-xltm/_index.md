<h2>Why to Convert MD to XLTM in C++</h2>

MD (Markdown) is a lightweight markup language used for formatting text documents. It is used to create webpages, blogs, and other documents. It is easy to read and write, and is often used in software development. However, it is not supported by many applications, and so it is necessary to convert MD to a more widely supported format. XLTM (Excel Template) is a Microsoft Excel file format that is used to store data and formatting information. It is widely used in business and other applications, and so it is a good choice for converting MD to.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MD document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MD file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.
