<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is a process of transforming emails from one format to another. For example, you may need to convert emails from EMLX to HTML or HTML to FLATOPC.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for emlx to flatopc conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating emails, documents, and images. It includes Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++. Aspose.Email for C++ API can be used to convert EMLX file format to HTML. After that, Aspose.Words for C++ API can be used to export HTML to FLATOPC. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package.

Using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert emails from EMLX to HTML and then export HTML to FLATOPC. It is a powerful and reliable solution for email conversion. It is easy to use and provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating emails, documents, and images. Moreover, it is a cost-effective solution as it comes with a single package.

1. Open EMLX file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMLX to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to FLATOPC format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set FlatOpc as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EMLX file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.emlx");
// save EMLX as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing FlatOpc as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.FlatOpc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EMLX File via C++" %}}
Not only you can convert your EMLX to FLATOPC, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMLX document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.emlx");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMLX to FLATOPC. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.FlatOpc");
```
