<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to SWF?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for formatting XML documents. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting details. SWF (Shockwave Flash) is a vector-based animation format used for creating interactive multimedia applications. Converting XSLFO to SWF allows developers to create interactive multimedia applications from XML documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XSLFO to SWF Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert documents, images, and other file formats. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, and other file formats. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate XSLFO to SWF conversion feature inside their C++ applications.

To export XSLFO to PPTX, developers can use Aspose.PDF for C++. It is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also supports exporting XSLFO to PPTX.

Once the XSLFO is exported to PPTX, developers can use Aspose.Slides for C++ to convert PPTX to SWF. It is a powerful presentation manipulation API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert presentations. It also supports converting PPTX to SWF.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate XSLFO to SWF conversion feature inside their C++ applications in two simple steps. First, they can export XSLFO to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, they can convert PPTX to SWF by using Aspose.Slides for C++.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XSLFO Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XSLFO to SWF, you can open a password protected XSLFO and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XSLFO file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XSLFO Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xslfo", L"owner");
// change password of XSLFO Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in SWF File via C++" %}}
After converting XSLFO to SWF, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a SWF file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a SWF file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.swf");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.swf", SaveFormat::Swf);
```
