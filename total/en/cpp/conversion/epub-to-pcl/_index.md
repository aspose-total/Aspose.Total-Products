<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to PCL?</h2>

EPUB is a popular file format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format for digital books and publications, which is based on XML and HTML. PCL is a page description language developed by Hewlett-Packard, which is used to control the printing of documents on a variety of printers and output devices. PCL is a popular format for printing documents, and it is often used in business applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to PCL in order to print documents in a professional manner.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for EPUB to PCL Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert EPUB to PCL in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert EPUB file format to DOC. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and printing. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to PCL. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating Word documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and printing. Moreover, Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a wide range of other file format automation libraries, such as Aspose.Cells for C++, Aspose.Email for C++, and Aspose.BarCode for C++, which can be used to automate various file format related tasks.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert EPUB to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to PCL format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of EPUB Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering EPUB to PCL, you can open a password protected EPUB and also change its password. In order to change the password of a EPUB file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing EPUB Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.epub", L"owner");
// change password of EPUB Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PCL File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict PCL file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Pcl");  
```
