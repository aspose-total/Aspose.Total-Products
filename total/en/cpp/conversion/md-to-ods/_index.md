<h2>Why to Convert MD to ODS</h2>

The MD (Markdown) format is a lightweight markup language used for writing plain text documents that can be easily converted to HTML for web publishing. On the other hand, the ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) format is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets, developed by the OpenDocument Format for Office Applications (ODF) and used by many applications, including OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Converting MD to ODS allows users to take advantage of the features of the ODS format, such as the ability to create complex formulas, charts, and graphs.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set MD File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MD document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MD file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save ODS File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving ODS file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
