<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is a process of transforming emails from one format to another. This process is useful for archiving emails, creating backups, or for other purposes.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to EPUB Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to convert emails from one format to another.

Using Aspose.Email for C++, you can convert EMAIL file format to HTML. After that, by using Aspose.Words for C++ API, you can export HTML to EPUB. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package.

Aspose.Email for C++ API provides a wide range of features for manipulating emails. It supports various email formats, such as MSG, EML, EMLX, MHTML, and MBOX. It also provides features for creating, reading, and converting emails.

Aspose.Words for C++ API is a powerful word processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert various document formats. It supports a wide range of document formats, such as DOC, DOCX, ODT, RTF, HTML, and PDF. It also provides features for creating, reading, and converting documents.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert emails from one format to another. It provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating emails and documents. It is a cost-effective solution for developers who need to add email conversion features inside their applications.

1. Open EMAIL file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMAIL to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to EPUB format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Epub as SaveFormat

```cpp
// load the EMAIL file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save EMAIL as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Epub as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Epub");

Not only you can convert your EMAIL to EPUB, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMAIL document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMAIL to EPUB. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Epub");
```
