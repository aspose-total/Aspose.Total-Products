<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to DOT?</h2>

EPUB is a popular file format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format that is supported by many e-book readers. However, it is not compatible with many other applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to other file formats such as DOC and DOT. 

DOC is a popular file format for documents, which is widely used for word processing. It is a proprietary file format developed by Microsoft and is supported by many applications. However, it is not compatible with many other applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert DOC to other file formats such as DOT. 

DOT is a popular file format for diagrams, which is widely used for creating diagrams. It is a proprietary file format developed by Microsoft and is supported by many applications. It is a vector-based file format that is suitable for creating diagrams with complex shapes.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of EPUB Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering EPUB to DOT, you can open a password protected EPUB and also change its password. In order to change the password of a EPUB file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing EPUB Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.epub", L"owner");
// change password of EPUB Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOT File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict DOT file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Dot");  
```
