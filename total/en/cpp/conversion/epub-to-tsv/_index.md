<h2>Why to Convert EPUB to TSV?</h2>

EPUB is a popular file format for e-books, which is widely used for digital publications. It is an open standard format for digital books and publications, which is based on the XML and HTML formats. However, TSV (Tab Separated Values) is a text file format that is used to store tabular data in plain text. It is a popular format for data exchange between different applications. Therefore, it is necessary to convert EPUB to TSV in order to make the data more accessible and easier to use.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set EPUB File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your EPUB document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a EPUB file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save TSV File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving TSV file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
