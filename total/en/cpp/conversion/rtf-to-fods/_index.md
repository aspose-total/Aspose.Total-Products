<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

RTF (Rich Text Format) is a document file format developed by Microsoft for exchanging text between different word processors. It is a popular format for exchanging documents between different applications and platforms. FODS (Flat OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is an open standard for electronic spreadsheets, developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). It is an XML-based format for storing spreadsheets and is used by many applications, such as OpenOffice.org Calc, LibreOffice Calc, and Microsoft Excel.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for RTF to FODS Conversion</h2>

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Access RTF Document Properties via C++" %}}
[Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) also allows you to access document properties of RTF file and lets you take an informed decision before the conversion process. To access document properties you can use [BuiltInDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.built_in_document_properties) to obtain built-in properties and [CustomDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.properties.custom_document_properties) to obtain custom properties. The following code example shows how to enumerate all built-in and custom properties in a document.
