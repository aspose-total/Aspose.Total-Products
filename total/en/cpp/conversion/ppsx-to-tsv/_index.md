<h2>Why to Convert PPSX to TSV?</h2>

The Portable Presentation Format (PPSX) is a file format used to store presentations created with Microsoft PowerPoint. It is a compressed version of the PowerPoint Presentation (PPT) file format. The Tab Separated Values (TSV) file format is a simple text format used for exchanging data between applications. It is a tabular data format that stores data in plain text, making it easy to read and write. Converting PPSX to TSV allows users to easily share data between applications.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TSV without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
