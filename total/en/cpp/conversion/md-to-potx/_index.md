<h2>Why to Convert MD to POTX?</h2>

If you are a C++ developer, you may need to integrate MD to POTX conversion feature inside your C++ applications. This is because the Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular format for sharing documents, but it is not suitable for editing. On the other hand, the PowerPoint Open XML (POTX) format is a Microsoft Office format that is used for creating and editing presentations. Therefore, if you need to edit a document, you will need to convert it from PDF to POTX.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to POTX Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can help you to easily convert MD to POTX. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. With Aspose.PDF for C++, you can export MD to PPTX. Then, with Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to POTX. Both APIs are available in the Aspose.Total for C++ package. 

The Aspose.Total for C++ package is easy to use and provides a wide range of features. It supports a variety of file formats, including PDF, PPTX, and POTX. It also provides a range of features such as document conversion, document manipulation, and document comparison. Furthermore, it is highly secure and reliable, so you can be sure that your documents are safe and secure.

In conclusion, if you are a C++ developer looking to integrate MD to POTX conversion feature inside your C++ applications, you can do it in two simple steps by using Aspose.Total for C++. It is easy to use and provides a wide range of features. It is also highly secure and reliable, so you can be sure that your documents are safe and secure.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to POTX, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in POTX File via C++" %}}
After converting MD to POTX, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a POTX file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a POTX file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.potx");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.potx", SaveFormat::Potx);
```
