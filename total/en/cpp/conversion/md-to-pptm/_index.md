<h2>Why to Convert MD to PPTM?</h2>

C++ developers often need to integrate MD to PPTM conversion feature inside their applications. This is because the Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation format (PPTM) is a widely used format for presentations, and is supported by many applications. It is also a great way to share presentations with colleagues, friends, and family.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to PPTM Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate MD to PPTM conversion feature inside their C++ applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export MD to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPTM respectively. 

The Aspose.PDF for C++ API allows developers to export MD to PPTX format. It supports a wide range of features, such as text extraction, image extraction, page manipulation, and more. It also supports a variety of file formats, including PDF, XPS, and MD.

The Aspose.Slides for C++ API enables developers to convert PPTX to PPTM format. It supports a wide range of features, such as text formatting, slide manipulation, animation, and more. It also supports a variety of file formats, including PPTX, PPTM, and PPSX.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate MD to PPTM conversion feature inside their C++ applications in just two simple steps. First, they can export MD to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, they can convert PPTX to PPTM by using Aspose.Slides for C++. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily add MD to PPTM conversion feature to their applications.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MD to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pptm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to PPTM, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPTM File via C++" %}}
After converting MD to PPTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pptm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pptm", SaveFormat::Pptm);
