<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

The Portable Office Document Markup Language (POTM) is a file format used to store presentations, spreadsheets, and documents. It is a proprietary format developed by Microsoft and is used by Microsoft Office applications. However, it is not compatible with other applications and platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to convert POTM files to other formats such as JSON in order to make them accessible to other applications and platforms.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for POTM to JSON Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a suite of APIs that enables developers to work with various file formats within C++ applications. It includes Aspose.Slides for C++ and Aspose.Cells for C++, which can be used to convert POTM files to JSON. 

Using Aspose.Slides for C++, you can export POTM to HTML. This API provides a wide range of features such as the ability to read, write, and manipulate presentations in various formats. It also supports the conversion of POTM to HTML.

Once the POTM file is converted to HTML, Aspose.Cells for C++ can be used to convert HTML to JSON. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with spreadsheets. It supports the conversion of HTML to JSON, as well as other formats such as CSV, XLSX, and PDF.

By using Aspose.Total for C++, you can convert POTM files to JSON within C++ applications in two simple steps. This makes it easy to make POTM files accessible to other applications and platforms.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input POTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
