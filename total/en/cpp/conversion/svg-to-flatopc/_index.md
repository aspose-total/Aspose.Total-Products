<h2>Why to Convert SVG to FLATOPC?</h2>

The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format is an open standard for vector graphics developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It is widely used for creating and sharing vector graphics on the web. However, the FLATOPC format is a proprietary format used by Microsoft Office applications such as Word and PowerPoint. It is used to store and share documents in a compressed format. Therefore, it is necessary to convert SVG to FLATOPC in order to share documents in the FLATOPC format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for SVG to FLATOPC Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert SVG to FLATOPC in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert SVG file format to DOC. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to FLATOPC. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a wide range of other features such as creating, editing, and converting various file formats, including PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and more. It also provides support for various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and more. Furthermore, Aspose.Total for C++ also provides support for various other features such as text extraction, document comparison, and more.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to FLATOPC format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to FLATOPC, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict FLATOPC File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict FLATOPC file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.FlatOpc");  
```
