[Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) file format automation libraries allows C++ developer to convert SVG to FLATOPC in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) API to convert SVG file format to DOC. Secondly, by using advanced Word Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/), you can export DOC to FLATOPC.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert SVG to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to FLATOPC format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with C++ File Automation APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load SVG file with an instance of Document class reference
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"sourceFile.svg");
// save SVG as a DOC 
doc->Save(u"DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat::Doc); 
// load DOC with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> wordDoc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"DocOutput.doc");
// save document as FlatOpc
wordDoc->Save(u"output.FlatOpc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of SVG Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering SVG to FLATOPC, you can open a password protected SVG and also change its password. In order to change the password of a SVG file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing SVG Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.svg", L"owner");
// change password of SVG Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict FLATOPC File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict FLATOPC file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.FlatOpc");  
```
