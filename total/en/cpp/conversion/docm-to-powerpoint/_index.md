<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

Converting documents from one format to another is a common task for many businesses. It is often necessary to convert documents from one format to another in order to make them easier to share, edit, or view. For example, converting a DOCM file to a PowerPoint presentation can make it easier to present the information in a more visually appealing way.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for DOCM to PowerPoint Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a powerful file automation API that allows users to automate the conversion of DOCM files to PowerPoint presentations. The API consists of two components: Aspose.Words for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.Words for C++ can be used to load the DOCM file and convert it to HTML. Aspose.Slides for C++ can then be used to load the HTML and create a new PowerPoint presentation. Finally, the presentation can be saved as a PowerPoint file. This process makes it easy to quickly and accurately convert DOCM files to PowerPoint presentations.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Load Password Protected DOCM Document via C++" %}}
Apart from document conversion, [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API allows tons of document manipulation features for C++ developers. In case your Microsoft Word DOCM file format is password protected, you can still open it using the API. In order to load the encrypted document, you can use a special constructor overload, which accepts a [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.loading.load_options) object. This object contains the Password property, which specifies the password string.  
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// when loading password protected document, the password is passed to the document's constructor using a LoadOptions object.
auto options = MakeObject<LoadOptions>(u"docPassword");
// load the document from the local file system by filename:
SharedPtr<Document> doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"Encrypted.docm", options);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Comments in POWERPOINT Document via C++" %}}
While saving DOCM as POWERPOINT, you can also use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to add further features in your POWERPOINT document. For instance, you can add comments in your presentation. The presentation slide comment are associated with a particular author. The Presentation class holds the collection of authors in ICommentAuthorCollection that are responsible for adding slide comments. For each author, there is a collection of comments in ICommentCollection.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate Presentation class
SharedPtr<Presentation>pres = MakeObject<Presentation>();
// access first slide
SharedPtr<ILayoutSlide>layout = pres->get_LayoutSlides()->idx_get(0);
// add empty slide
pres->get_Slides()->AddEmptySlide(layout);
// adding Author
SharedPtr<ICommentAuthor> author = pres->get_CommentAuthors()->AddAuthor(u"John Doe", u"MF");
// set position of comments
System::Drawing::PointF point = System::Drawing::PointF(0.2f, 0.2f);
// add slide comment for an author on slide 1
author->get_Comments()->AddComment(u"Hello John, this is a slide comment", pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(1), point, DateTime::get_Now());
// access ISlide 1
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// save presentation as Pptx
pres->Save(output.pptx, Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pptx);
