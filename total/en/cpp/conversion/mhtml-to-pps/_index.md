<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

C++ developers often need to integrate MHTML to PPS conversion feature inside their applications. MHTML is a web page archive format that is used to save webpages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources such as images, audio, and video. PPS is a Microsoft PowerPoint Show file format that is used to store slideshows. It is a read-only format that can be used to present slideshows without making any changes to the content. Therefore, C++ developers need to convert MHTML to PPS in order to present slideshows without making any changes to the content.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MHTML to PPS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. Aspose.PDF for C++ can be used to export MHTML to PPTX. Aspose.Slides for C++ can be used to convert PPTX to PPS. Therefore, developers can use Aspose.Total for C++ to convert MHTML to PPS in two simple steps. First, they can export MHTML to PPTX by using Aspose.PDF for C++. Secondly, they can convert PPTX to PPS by using Aspose.Slides for C++.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MHTML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pps` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to PPS, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPS File via C++" %}}
After converting MHTML to PPS, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPS file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pps");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pps", SaveFormat::Pps);
