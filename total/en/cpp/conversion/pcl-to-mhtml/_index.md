<h2>Why to Convert PCL to MHTML</h2>

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a widely used file format for documents. However, it is not always the most suitable format for web-based applications. MHTML, or MIME HTML, is a web page archive format that is used to store web pages and associated resources in a single file. It is a more suitable format for web-based applications, as it can be easily viewed in a web browser. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PCL files to MHTML.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PCL to MHTML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert PCL to MHTML in two simple steps. Firstly, the Aspose.PDF for C++ API can be used to convert PCL files to DOC format. Secondly, the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, can be used to export the DOC file to MHTML. This makes it easy for C++ developers to quickly and easily convert PCL files to MHTML. 

Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other features that make it an ideal choice for file format automation. It supports a wide range of file formats, including PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, HTML, MHTML, and many more. It also provides a range of features such as document conversion, document manipulation, document comparison, document signing, and more. Aspose.Total for C++ is a powerful and comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that makes it easy for C++ developers to quickly and easily convert PCL to MHTML.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PCL Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PCL to MHTML, you can open a password protected PCL and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PCL file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PCL Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pcl", L"owner");
// change password of PCL Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict MHTML File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict MHTML file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Mhtml");  
```
