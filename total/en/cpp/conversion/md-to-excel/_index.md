Converting MD to EXCEL in C++ can be done quickly and easily with the help of Aspose.Total for C++ file format automation libraries. This two-step process begins with exporting MD to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for C++. This library provides a range of features for creating, editing, and manipulating PDF documents. After the MD file has been converted to XLSX, Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API can be used to convert the XLSX file to EXCEL. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for working with Excel spreadsheets, including creating, editing, and manipulating worksheets, cells, and charts. With the help of these two libraries, developers can quickly and easily convert MD to EXCEL in C++. Aspose.Total for C++ also provides a range of other file format automation libraries, making it a great choice for developers who need to work with a variety of file formats.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set MD File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your MD document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a MD file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save EXCEL File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving EXCEL file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
