<h2>Why to Convert MD to XAMLFLOW?</h2>

The MD file format is a popular format for storing and sharing documents. It is widely used in the software development industry, as it is easy to read and write. However, the XAMLFLOW format is a more advanced format that is used for creating interactive documents. It is used for creating documents with interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and charts. By converting MD to XAMLFLOW, developers can create more interactive documents that can be used in a variety of applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for MD to XAMLFLOW Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive file format automation library that allows C++ developers to easily convert MD to XAMLFLOW. The library includes two powerful APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to convert MD to DOC and then export DOC to XAMLFLOW. Aspose.PDF for C++ is a powerful PDF document processing API that can be used to convert MD to DOC. Aspose.Words for C++ is an advanced Word document processing API that can be used to export DOC to XAMLFLOW. With Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily convert MD to XAMLFLOW in just two simple steps.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert MD to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to XAMLFLOW format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MD Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MD to XAMLFLOW, you can open a password protected MD and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MD file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MD Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.md", L"owner");
// change password of MD Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict XAMLFLOW File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict XAMLFLOW file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Xamlflow");  
```
