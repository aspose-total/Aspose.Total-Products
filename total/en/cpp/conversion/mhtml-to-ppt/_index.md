<h2>Why to Convert MHTML to PPT?</h2>

MHTML (MIME HTML) is a web page archive format used to save webpages for offline viewing. It is a combination of HTML code and resources like images, audio, and video. It is a popular format for saving and sharing webpages. On the other hand, PPT (PowerPoint) is a popular presentation format used to create slideshows. It is widely used for creating presentations for business, education, and other purposes. Therefore, it is important to convert MHTML to PPT for creating presentations from webpages.

<h2>How Aspose.Total helps for MHTML to PPT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that helps developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It includes APIs for PDF, Slides, Words, and other file formats. It helps developers to add features like MHTML to PPT conversion to their C++ applications.

To export MHTML to PPTX, developers can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API. It helps developers to convert MHTML to PDF and then to PPTX. Secondly, developers can use Aspose.Slides for C++ API to convert PPTX to PPT. Both APIs come under Aspose.Total for C++ package. Therefore, developers can easily integrate MHTML to PPT conversion feature inside their C++ applications by using Aspose.Total for C++.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of MHTML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering MHTML to PPT, you can open a password protected MHTML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a MHTML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing MHTML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.mhtml", L"owner");
// change password of MHTML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPT File via C++" %}}
After converting MHTML to PPT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppt");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppt", SaveFormat::Ppt);
