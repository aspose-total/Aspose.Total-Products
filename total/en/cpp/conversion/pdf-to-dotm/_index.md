<h2>Why to Convert PDF to DOTM?</h2>

The DOTM file format is a Microsoft Word Open XML Macro-Enabled Document Template, which is used to store documents with macros. It is a great choice for documents that require macros to be used, as it allows the user to save the document with the macros intact. This makes it a great choice for documents that require a lot of formatting, such as reports, presentations, and other documents that require a lot of formatting.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PDF Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PDF to DOTM, you can open a password protected PDF and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PDF file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PDF Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pdf", L"owner");
// change password of PDF Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOTM File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict DOTM file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Dotm");  
```
