<h2>Why to Convert PDF to PPTM?</h2>

PDF to PPTM conversion is a useful feature for C++ developers who want to integrate PDF to PPTM conversion feature inside their applications. PDF files are widely used for sharing documents, but they are not suitable for presentations. PPTM files are more suitable for presentations as they are editable and can be used to create visually appealing presentations. Converting PDF to PPTM allows users to create presentations from PDF documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for PDF to PPTM Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, manipulate, and convert documents. It includes Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export PDF to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPTM, respectively. Aspose.PDF for C++ allows developers to export PDF documents to PPTX format, while Aspose.Slides for C++ enables developers to convert PPTX documents to PPTM format. Both APIs are available as part of the Aspose.Total for C++ package.

Using Aspose.Total for C++, developers can easily integrate PDF to PPTM conversion feature into their C++ applications. The APIs provide a wide range of features and functions that allow developers to manipulate and convert documents with ease. Furthermore, the APIs are easy to use and can be integrated into existing applications quickly and easily.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of PDF Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering PDF to PPTM, you can open a password protected PDF and also change its password. In order to change the password of a PDF file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing PDF Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.pdf", L"owner");
// change password of PDF Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPTM File via C++" %}}
After converting PDF to PPTM, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPTM file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTM file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pptm");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pptm", SaveFormat::Pptm);
