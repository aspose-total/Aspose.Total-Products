<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

If you are a C++ developer looking to add a feature to your application that allows for the conversion of TEX to PPS, then you have come to the right place. TEX is a document format used for typesetting documents, while PPS is a presentation format used for creating slideshows. Converting between the two formats can be a useful way to create presentations from existing documents.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for TEX to PPS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a package of APIs that can help you with the conversion of TEX to PPS. It includes two APIs: Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++. With Aspose.PDF for C++, you can export TEX to PPTX, and with Aspose.Slides for C++, you can convert PPTX to PPS. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, so you can get both of them in one convenient package. 

Using Aspose.Total for C++, you can easily convert TEX to PPS in two simple steps. First, you can export TEX to PPTX using Aspose.PDF for C++. Then, you can convert PPTX to PPS using Aspose.Slides for C++. This makes it easy to add the TEX to PPS conversion feature to your C++ applications. 

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive package of APIs that can help you with a variety of tasks related to document and presentation conversion. It includes both Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, so you can easily convert TEX to PPS in two simple steps. With Aspose.Total for C++, you can quickly and easily add the TEX to PPS conversion feature to your C++ applications.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) method function
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class reference 
4. Save the document to PPS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) member function and set `Pps` as SaveFormat

// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of TEX Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering TEX to PPS, you can open a password protected TEX and also change its password. In order to change the password of a TEX file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing TEX Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.tex", L"owner");
// change password of TEX Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPS File via C++" %}}
After converting TEX to PPS, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPS file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.pps");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.pps", SaveFormat::Pps);
```
