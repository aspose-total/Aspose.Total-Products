<h2>Why to Convert XML to PPT?</h2>

XML to PPT conversion is a useful feature for C++ developers who want to add a presentation layer to their applications. XML is a markup language used to store and transport data, while PPT is a presentation format used to create slideshows. By converting XML to PPT, developers can create visually appealing presentations with their data.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for XML to PPT Conversion?</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily integrate XML to PPT conversion into their C++ applications. It includes two APIs, Aspose.PDF for C++ and Aspose.Slides for C++, which can be used to export XML to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPT respectively.

Using Aspose.PDF for C++, developers can export XML to PPTX in just two simple steps. First, they can load the XML file into the API and then export it to PPTX. Aspose.Slides for C++ can then be used to convert the PPTX file to PPT. This API also supports a wide range of features, such as creating, editing, and converting presentations.

Overall, Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy for developers to integrate XML to PPT conversion into their C++ applications. It provides a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to export XML to PPTX and convert PPTX to PPT. This makes it a great choice for developers who want to add a presentation layer to their applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of XML Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering XML to PPT, you can open a password protected XML and also change its password. In order to change the password of a XML file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing XML Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.xml", L"owner");
// change password of XML Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Images From Web in PPT File via C++" %}}
After converting XML to PPT, you can also add images from web to your output document. [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) supports operations with images in these popular formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others. You can add one or several images on your computer onto a slide in a presentation. This sample code in C++ shows you how to add an image to a PPT file
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>("output.ppt");
// get slide
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// initialize Web Client    
auto webClient = System::MakeObject<WebClient>();
// get image data
auto imageData = webClient->DownloadData(System::MakeObject<Uri>(u"[REPLACE WITH URL]"));
// add image
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(imageData);
// add picture frame
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
// save updated file
pres->Save(u"updated.ppt", SaveFormat::Ppt);
