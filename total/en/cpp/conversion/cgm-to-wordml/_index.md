<h2>Why to Convert CGM to WORDML</h2>

The CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) file format is a vector graphics format used for storing and exchanging graphics data. It is widely used in the engineering and technical drawing fields, but is not suitable for use in word processing applications. WORDML (WordprocessingML) is an XML-based file format used by Microsoft Word to store documents. It is a more versatile format than CGM, and is suitable for use in a variety of applications. Therefore, it is often necessary to convert CGM files to WORDML in order to make them compatible with word processing applications.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to WORDML Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that allows C++ developers to easily convert CGM to WORDML in two simple steps. Firstly, you can use Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert CGM file format to DOC. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF files to other formats such as DOC. Secondly, by using the advanced Word Document Processing API Aspose.Words for C++, you can export DOC to WORDML. This API provides a wide range of features for manipulating Word documents, including the ability to convert DOC files to other formats such as WORDML. Aspose.Total for C++ is a powerful and reliable solution for converting CGM to WORDML quickly and easily.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class reference
2. Convert CGM to DOC by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#adb8061c585440fde49c1263e68837f01) member function
3. Load DOC file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference of Aspose.Words API
4. Save the document to WORDML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stream_saveformat) member function

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of CGM Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering CGM to WORDML, you can open a password protected CGM and also change its password. In order to change the password of a CGM file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing CGM Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.cgm", L"owner");
// change password of CGM Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict WORDML File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict WORDML file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.WordML");  
```
