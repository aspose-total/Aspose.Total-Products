<h2>Why to Convert XSLFO to TXT?</h2>

XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) is an XML-based language used for formatting documents. It is used to define the layout of a document, such as page size, margins, fonts, and other formatting details. It is used to generate PDF documents, but it is not suitable for other types of documents. TXT (Plain Text) is a universal file format that can be used to store any type of text-based data. It is a widely used format for storing and sharing data, and it is supported by almost all text editors and word processors. Therefore, it is necessary to convert XSLFO to TXT in order to make the data more accessible and easier to share.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XSLFO document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XSLFO file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save TXT File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving TXT file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
