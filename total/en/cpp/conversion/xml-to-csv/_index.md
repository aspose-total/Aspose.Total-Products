Converting XML to CSV in C++ can be easily achieved by using the Aspose.Total for C++ file format automation libraries. This two-step process begins by using the Aspose.PDF for C++ library to export the XML file to XLSX. Once the XML file has been converted to XLSX, the Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API can be used to convert the XLSX file to CSV. 

The Aspose.Total for C++ library is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that can be used to create, edit, and convert a wide range of file formats. The Aspose.PDF for C++ library is specifically designed to work with PDF documents, allowing users to export XML files to XLSX. The Aspose.Cells for C++ library is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that can be used to convert XLSX files to CSV. 

The Aspose.Total for C++ library is easy to use and provides a simple way to convert XML to CSV in C++. The two-step process begins by using the Aspose.PDF for C++ library to export the XML file to XLSX. Once the XML file has been converted to XLSX, the Aspose.Cells for C++ Spreadsheet Programming API can be used to convert the XLSX file to CSV. This process is fast and efficient, allowing users to quickly and easily convert XML to CSV in C++.

[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your XML document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a XML file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save CSV File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving CSV file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
