<h2>Why to Convert CGM to XLTM</h2>

Converting CGM to XLTM is a useful process for many reasons. XLTM is a Microsoft Excel Open XML Macro-Enabled Template file format, which is used to store Excel documents that contain macros. This file format is used to store data in a structured format, which makes it easier to access and manipulate the data. Additionally, XLTM files are more secure than other file formats, as they are encrypted and can only be opened with the correct password.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get or Set CGM File Information via C++" %}}
[Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) also allows you to get information about your CGM document and lets you take informed decisions before your conversion process. In order to get file specific information of a CGM file, you first need to call the [get_Info()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#ae7a6ba620499ffa0dbaa5c813ee96c4a) method of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) class. Once the DocumentInfo object is retrieved, you can get the values of the individual properties. Furthermore, you can also set the properties by using respective methods of DocumentInfo class.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Save XLTM File Format to Stream via C++" %}}
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) allows saving XLTM file format to stream. To save files to a stream, create a MemoryStream or FileStream object and save the file to that stream object by calling the [IWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook) objectâ€™s [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_workbook#a77072cfb929787df9ad1f38b02f58349) method. Specify the desired file format using the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/namespace/aspose.cells#a11cae527e4e68f1adcac8f47ea64481a) enumeration when calling the Save method.
