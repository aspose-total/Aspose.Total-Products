<h2>Why to Convert</h2>

As a C++ developer, you may need to add email conversion features inside your applications. Email conversion is the process of transforming an email message from one format to another. This can be useful for archiving emails, or for displaying them in a different format.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for Email to XPS Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the tools they need to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It includes two APIs that can be used to convert emails to XPS: Aspose.Email for C++ and Aspose.Words for C++.

Aspose.Email for C++ is an API that allows developers to convert emails from one format to another. It can be used to convert emails from EMAIL to HTML.

Aspose.Words for C++ is an API that allows developers to convert documents from one format to another. It can be used to convert HTML to XPS.

By combining these two APIs, developers can easily convert emails from EMAIL to XPS. Both APIs are included in the Aspose.Total for C++ package, making it easy to access all the features of both APIs in one convenient package.

1. Open EMAIL file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMAIL to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to XPS format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Xps as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cpp
// load the EMAIL file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save EMAIL as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Xps as save format
doc->Save(u"convertedFile.Xps");

Not only you can convert your EMAIL to XPS, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMAIL document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="C++ API to Restrict XPS File Format Editing" %}}
You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMAIL to XPS. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Xps");
```
