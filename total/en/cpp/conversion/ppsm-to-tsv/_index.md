<h2>Why to Convert PPSM to TSV</h2>

The Portable Presentation Slide Master (PPSM) file format is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint to store slide masters. It is used to store the design elements of a presentation, such as the background, fonts, colors, and other formatting. However, the PPSM file format is not widely supported by other applications, making it difficult to share and edit the file. 

The Tab Separated Values (TSV) file format is a widely supported, plain text format that is used to store tabular data. It is a popular format for exchanging data between applications, and is supported by a wide range of applications, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers. 

Therefore, it is often necessary to convert PPSM files to TSV in order to make the data more widely accessible and easier to share and edit.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input PPSM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to TSV without using the password.  When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to open an encrypted document with a password.
