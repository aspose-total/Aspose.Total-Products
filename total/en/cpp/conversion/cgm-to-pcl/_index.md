<h2>Why to Convert CGM to PCL</h2>

The PCL (Printer Command Language) file format is a page description language used to control the printing of documents on a wide range of printers and other output devices. It is a popular format for printing documents, as it is supported by a wide range of printers and other output devices. PCL files are also more compact than other file formats, making them ideal for sending over the internet.

<h2>How Aspose.Total Helps for CGM to PCL Conversion</h2>

Aspose.Total for C++ is a comprehensive suite of file format automation libraries that enables C++ developers to easily convert CGM to PCL. It includes the powerful Aspose.PDF for C++ API, which can be used to convert CGM files to DOC, and the advanced Word Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for C++, which can be used to export DOC to PCL. 

The Aspose.PDF for C++ API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to convert CGM files to DOC. It also supports a wide range of other file formats, including HTML, XPS, and SVG. The API also provides a range of features for manipulating PDF documents, such as adding text, images, and annotations.

The Aspose.Words for C++ API provides a range of features for manipulating Word documents, including the ability to export DOC to PCL. It also supports a wide range of other file formats, including HTML, RTF, and ODT. The API also provides a range of features for manipulating Word documents, such as adding text, images, and tables.

Aspose.Total for C++ makes it easy for C++ developers to convert CGM to PCL in two simple steps. Firstly, they can use the Aspose.PDF for C++ API to convert CGM files to DOC. Secondly, they can use the Aspose.Words for C++ API to export DOC to PCL. This makes it easy for C++ developers to quickly and easily convert CGM to PCL.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Change Password of CGM Document via C++" %}}
In the process of rendering CGM to PCL, you can open a password protected CGM and also change its password. In order to change the password of a CGM file, you must know the owner password of that document. You can load password protected PDF document with [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) by specifying its owner password and use ChangePasswords method to change the password.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load an existing CGM Document
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(L"input.cgm", L"owner");
// change password of CGM Document
doc->ChangePasswords(L"owner", L"newuser", L"newuser");
// save the document
doc->Save(L"output.Doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PCL File Editing via C++" %}}
You can also restrict PCL file editing using using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. API enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#protectiontype) enumeration parameter. The following code example demonstrates how to restrict editing in a document so only editing in form fields is possible.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cpp
// load Doc with an instance of Document
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("input.doc");
// document protection only works when document protection is turned and only editing in form fields is allowed.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::AllowOnlyFormFields, u"password");
// save the protected document.
doc->Save(u"Protected.Pcl");  
```
