We use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/), a child API of [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) designed for particular presentation manipulation features as well as tasks associated with retrieving and searching its content. Below code operates on a PowerPoint presentation. It begins by loading a presentation file using Aspose.Slides. The code then employs the SlideUtil::FindAndReplaceText function to find and replace the text throughout the presentation, with the 'true' parameter indicating case-sensitive matching. Finally, it saves the updated presentation. So this code automates the process of finding and replacing specific text within a PowerPoint presentation. Moreover, Document C++ Search Library also supports PDF, Microsoft [Word document search](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/search/word/) and other formats as well.
