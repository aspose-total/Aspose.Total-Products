Document watermarking serves as a crucial tool for protecting the integrity and ownership of digital documents. By embedding visible or invisible marks, such as text, logos, or patterns, into documents, watermarking enables content creators to assert their ownership and deter unauthorized use or distribution. Additionally, watermarking enhances document security by discouraging tampering or forgery, as any alterations to the document's content become readily apparent. <br /><br />

Integrating document watermarking into a C++ application offers enhanced content authentication, ownership assertion, and copyright protection. Visible or invisible marks embedded within documents deter unauthorized use and reinforce brand identity. This ensures compliance with legal regulations while providing traceability and accountability in collaborative environments, strengthening overall document security.
