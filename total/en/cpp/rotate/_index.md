Document rotation serves as a vital function in digital document management, offering users the ability to adjust the orientation of documents to suit their viewing preferences or specific requirements. Whether dealing with scanned documents, images, or PDFs, the need for document rotation arises when content is captured or received in an orientation that is not aligned with the intended reading direction. This feature allows users to easily correct document orientation, ensuring optimal readability and usability. Additionally, document rotation is essential for maintaining consistency and clarity in document presentation, especially when sharing or printing documents across different devices or platforms. <br /><br />

Utilizing C++ for document management applications ensures efficient handling of documents, thanks to its optimized memory management and processing speeds. Its cross-platform compatibility enhances accessibility, while robustness and scalability support advanced features like encryption and indexing.
