We use [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/), a child API of [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) designed for particular document manipulation features as well as tasks associated with retrieving and searching document content. Below code snippet is written in C# to interact with a PDF document. It first sets up a regular expression pattern to search for sequences of non-whitespace characters within the document. Next, it accesses the first page of the PDF and employs a TextFragmentAbsorber to search for text on that page using the specified regular expression. The code then collects the discovered text fragments into a collection. Finally, it iterates through this collection and outputs each identified text fragment to the console. Essentially, this code snippet serves as a mechanism to extract and display specific text patterns from a PDF document. Moreover, .NET Search API also supports Microsoft [Word document search](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/search/word/) and other formats as well.
