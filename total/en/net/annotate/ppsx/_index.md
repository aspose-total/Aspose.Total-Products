- **Final Slide Feedback**  
  Insert annotations on slide visuals, timing, or messaging for pre-publishing review.

- **Accessibility Enhancements**  
  Suggest improvements for visual clarity, color contrast, or reading order.

- **Brand Compliance Checks**  
  Annotate deviations from approved branding elements.

- **Localization Suggestions**  
  Highlight areas requiring language or regional updates.

- **Training Playback Review**  
  Provide feedback on pacing, transitions, and comprehension in self-running courses.
