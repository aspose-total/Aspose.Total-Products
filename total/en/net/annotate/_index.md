Document annotation refers to the process of adding metadata, comments, or other types of information to a document to provide additional context or to highlight specific elements within the document. Annotations can include text notes, highlights, shapes, comments, and other types of markers that help users understand or interact with the content of a document. Document annotation is commonly used in various industries such as legal, healthcare, education, and business for tasks like document review, collaboration, and analysis. <br /><br />

Managing document annotation via .NET-based applications leverages the .NET framework's integration with Microsoft technologies, providing seamless compatibility with Microsoft Office, SharePoint, and Azure. The framework's rich library support, strong typing, and language features, along with its security and performance optimizations, make it a preferred choice for building applications that handle and manipulate annotated documents.
