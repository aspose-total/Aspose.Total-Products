{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from MD File via .NET" %}}
While converting MD to ODP, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a MD file’s XMP metadata. To get a MD file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input MD file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only ODP File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your ODP file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make ODP read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Odp
presentation.Save("output.odp", SaveFormat.Odp);

MD (MarkDown) files are used to store text content, making them ideal for creating documentation and content. However, when working with layout and presentation requirements, ODP (OpenDocument Presentation) formats become essential for creating visually appealing slideshows and presentations.

The conversion of MD files into ODP formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your visual presentation and design capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Conference Presentations**: Convert MD files to create engaging conference presentations, incorporating text, images, and multimedia content.
*   **Training Materials**: Use ODP to visualize training materials, such as course outlines, lecture notes, and handouts, making them more accessible and interactive.
*   **Corporate Communications**: Convert MD files to create professional-looking internal communications, including company updates, policy documents, and employee handbooks.
*   **Educational Resources**: Use ODP to develop visually appealing educational resources, including textbooks, workbooks, and online course materials.
*   **Marketing Materials**: Convert MD files to create eye-catching marketing materials, such as brochures, flyers, and sales sheets.
