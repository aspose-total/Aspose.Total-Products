Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive API that provides developers with the tools to add powerful document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which enables developers to convert TEX file format to DOC. This is followed by the Aspose.Words for .NET API, which allows developers to render DOC to DOTM. 

The Aspose.PDF for .NET API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents. It can be used to create, edit, and convert PDF documents, as well as to extract text, images, and other content from PDFs. It also supports the conversion of PDFs to other popular file formats, such as HTML, XPS, and TIFF. 

The Aspose.Words for .NET API is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents in various formats. It supports a wide range of document formats, including DOC, DOCX, DOTM, and HTML. It also provides features for manipulating document elements, such as text, images, tables, and shapes.

3. Load Doc file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class of Aspose.Words 
4. Save the document to DOTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.document/save/methods/4) method and set Dotm as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt TEX File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting TEX to DOTM, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the TEX using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.tex", "password");
// decrypt TEX
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly DOTM- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your DOTM from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Dotm
document.Save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.Dotm);
