<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in PDF to Excel Conversion?</h2>

[Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) provides an efficient solution for converting PDF files to Excel formats using .NET, C#, ASP.NET, and VB.NET applications. The conversion process is simple and involves two API's from the Aspose product suite, namely [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) and [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/).<br><br>

To begin, Aspose.PDF for .NET allows the export of PDF files to XLSX format. This API provides a range of options and settings for exporting PDF files to Excel, enabling developers to control the conversion process. Once the PDF file is exported to XLSX format, the Aspose.Cells for .NET Spreadsheet Programming API can be used to convert the XLSX file to Excel format. This API offers comprehensive functionality to manipulate and convert Excel files, allowing for a seamless conversion process.<br><br>

The combination of Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Cells for .NET provides developers with a powerful solution for PDF to Excel conversion, with the added benefit of flexible customization options to suit individual project requirements.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Why Convert PDF to Excel formats?" %}}
There are several reasons why someone might need to convert a PDF file to an Excel format. One common reason is to extract data from a PDF document that is in a table or spreadsheet format and convert it into an editable Excel spreadsheet. This can save a lot of time and effort, as retyping data from a PDF can be tedious and error-prone.<br><br>

Another reason to convert a PDF to an Excel format is to analyze or manipulate the data in more advanced ways. Excel offers many features for data analysis, such as sorting, filtering, and creating charts and graphs, that are not available in a PDF file. Additionally, Excel allows for complex calculations and formulas, which can be used to derive insights from the data that would be difficult or impossible to obtain from a PDF.<br><br>

Finally, some organizations may require data to be presented in a particular format, such as an Excel spreadsheet. By converting a PDF to an Excel format, one can ensure that the data is presented in a standardized format that is easy to work with and meets any specific requirements or regulations.<br><br>

If your PDF document is password protected, you cannot convert it to Excel without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it.  In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and pass the filename and password as arguments.

While converting PDF file to Excel, you can also add watermark to your output Excel file format. In order to add a watermark, you can create a new Workbook object and open the converted XLSX document, select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its AddTextEffect function. After that you can save your XLSX document as Excel with Watermark.
