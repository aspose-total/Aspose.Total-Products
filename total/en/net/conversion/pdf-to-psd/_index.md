Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export PDF to PSD image within any .NET applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are two powerful components that can be used to export PDF to PSD image.

The process of exporting PDF to PSD image can be done in two simple steps. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export PDF to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features that enable developers to manipulate PDF documents in various ways. It supports a variety of features such as document conversion, text extraction, page manipulation, and more.

Once the PDF document is converted to JPEG, you can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to PSD. This powerful Image Processing API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to manipulate images in various ways. It supports a variety of features such as image conversion, image resizing, image cropping, image rotation, and more.

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export PDF to PSD image within any .NET applications. This suite of components provides a wide range of features that enable developers to manipulate PDF documents and images in various ways.

1. Open PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render PDF to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to PSD format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to PSD to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PDF document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to PSD. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to PSD format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF to PSD With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to PSD with watermark in your PSD document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your PDF document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as PSD format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PDF File to PSD via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output PSD image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
