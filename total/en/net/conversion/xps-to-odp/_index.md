Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to Render XPS to ODP in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the XPS file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert XPS to PPTX. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to ODP. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert PPTX to ODP. It also supports a wide range of presentation formats, including ODP, PPT, PPTX, PPS, PPSX, and more. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily and quickly Render XPS to ODP in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, can be used to convert XPS to PPTX, and the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert PPTX to ODP. Both APIs provide a wide range of features to create, edit, and manipulate documents and presentations, making it easy to Render XPS to ODP.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert XPS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to ODP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Odp` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from XPS File via .NET" %}}
While converting XPS to ODP, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a XPS file’s XMP metadata. To get a XPS file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input XPS file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open XPS document
Document doc = new Document("input.xps");
// get XPS XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only ODP File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your ODP file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make ODP read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Odp
presentation.Save("output.odp", SaveFormat.Odp);
