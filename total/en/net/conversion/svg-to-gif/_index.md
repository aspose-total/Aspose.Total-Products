Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to add powerful document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which provides advanced PDF processing capabilities, and the Aspose.Words for .NET API, which provides powerful document processing features. 

Using Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can easily convert SVG file formats to DOC. This API provides a wide range of features, including the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF documents, as well as the ability to extract text, images, and other content from PDF documents. It also supports the conversion of PDF documents to other popular file formats, such as HTML, XPS, and TIFF. 

Once the SVG file has been converted to DOC, developers can use the Aspose.Words for .NET API to render the DOC file to GIF. This API provides a range of features for working with DOC files, including the ability to create, edit, and convert DOC files, as well as the ability to extract text, images, and other content from DOC files. It also supports the conversion of DOC files to other popular file formats, such as HTML, XPS, and TIFF. 

In addition to the features mentioned above, Aspose.Total for .NET also includes APIs for working with other popular file formats, such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. With Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily add powerful document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications. This comprehensive suite of APIs makes it easy to convert SVG files to DOC and then render the DOC file to GIF.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt SVG File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting SVG to GIF, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the SVG using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.svg", "password");
// decrypt SVG
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly GIF- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your GIF from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Gif
document.Save("output.gif", SaveFormat.Gif);
