Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to parse JSON to JPEG2000 within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. This powerful suite of components provides a simple two-step process to convert JSON to JPEG2000. 

The first step is to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to export JSON to JPEG. This component is a powerful spreadsheet processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert and render spreadsheet documents without requiring Microsoft Excel. It supports a wide range of features such as data validation, conditional formatting, pivot tables, charts, and more. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, developers can easily export JSON to JPEG with just a few lines of code. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to JPEG2000. This component is a powerful imaging API that enables developers to create, edit, convert and render images without requiring any additional software. It supports a wide range of image formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, BMP, and more. With Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can easily convert JPEG to JPEG2000 with just a few lines of code. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily parse JSON to JPEG2000 within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. This powerful suite of components provides a simple two-step process to convert JSON to JPEG2000. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, developers can export JSON to JPEG and with Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can convert JPEG to JPEG2000. This makes it easy for developers to parse JSON to JPEG2000 within any .NET application.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) object and read JSON data from file
2. Convert JSON to JPEG using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.workbook/save/methods/4) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to JPEG2000 via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to JPEG2000, you can also set layout options for your JSON using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse JSON Format to JPEG2000 with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to JPEG2000 with watermark in your JPEG2000 document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your JSON document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark to it, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.
