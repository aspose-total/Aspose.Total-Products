Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export TEX to APNG image within any .NET applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are both powerful APIs that can be used to achieve this goal. 

The first step in the process is to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export TEX to JPEG. This API provides a wide range of features that make it easy to convert TEX to JPEG. It supports a variety of formats, including TEX, PDF, HTML, and more. It also provides a range of options for customizing the output, such as setting the resolution, color depth, and more. 

Once the TEX has been converted to JPEG, the next step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert the JPEG to APNG. This API provides a range of features for image processing, including resizing, cropping, rotating, and more. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, BMP, and more. With this API, you can easily convert JPEG to APNG with just a few lines of code. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily export TEX to APNG image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export TEX to JPEG. Then, you can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert the JPEG to APNG. With this suite of APIs, you can quickly and easily convert TEX to APNG with just a few lines of code.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render TEX to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to APNG format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with .NET File Automation APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total``` or install directly from Package Manager Console of Visual Studio.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/net).

Using the API, you can also convert TEX file to APNG to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your TEX document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to APNG. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to APNG format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert TEX to APNG With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert TEX file to APNG with watermark in your APNG document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your TEX document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as APNG format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate TEX File to APNG via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output APNG image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
