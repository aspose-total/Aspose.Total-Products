Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily export CGM to EMZ image within any .NET applications. This suite of APIs provides a wide range of features and functionalities, allowing developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render various file formats. 

The process of exporting CGM to EMZ image can be completed in two simple steps. First, developers can use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export CGM to JPEG. This API provides a wide range of features and functionalities, allowing developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render various file formats. It also provides a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to convert CGM to JPEG. 

Once the CGM file has been converted to JPEG, developers can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET Image Processing API to convert JPEG to EMZ. This API provides a wide range of features and functionalities, allowing developers to create, manipulate, convert, and render various image file formats. It also provides a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating images, including the ability to convert JPEG to EMZ. 

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for .NET provides a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily export CGM to EMZ image within any .NET applications. By using Aspose.PDF for .NET to export CGM to JPEG, and Aspose.Imaging for .NET Image Processing API to convert JPEG to EMZ, developers can quickly and easily complete the process of exporting CGM to EMZ image.

1. Open CGM file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render CGM to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to EMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Using the API, you can also convert CGM file to EMZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your CGM document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to EMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to EMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert CGM to EMZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert CGM file to EMZ with watermark in your EMZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your CGM document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as EMZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate CGM File to EMZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output EMZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
