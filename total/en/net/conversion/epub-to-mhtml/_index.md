{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt EPUB File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting EPUB to MHTML, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the EPUB using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly MHTML- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your MHTML from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Mhtml
document.Save("output.mhtml", SaveFormat.Mhtml);    
```

Epub (Electronic Publication) files are used to store digital content, including e-books, articles, and other types of publications. However, when working with web-based applications, MHTML (MIME HTML) formats become essential for sharing and viewing digital content.

The conversion of Epub files into MHTML formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your digital content sharing capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Web Content Sharing**: Convert Epub files to share web-based content, such as articles, blogs, and e-books, with a wider audience.
*   **Digital Magazine Publishing**: Use MHTML to create interactive digital magazines, including multimedia content and hyperlinks.
*   **E-book Distribution**: Convert Epub files to distribute e-books and other digital publications through online platforms.
*   **Online Course Materials**: Use MHTML to share educational resources, such as lecture notes, videos, and presentations, with students.
*   **Digital Asset Management**: Convert Epub files to manage and share digital assets, including images, videos, and documents, across various devices and platforms.
