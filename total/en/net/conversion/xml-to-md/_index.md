<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert XML files to MD (Markdown) format?</h2>

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax that can be easily converted to HTML and other formats. XML, on the other hand, is a markup language used for storing and exchanging structured data. The main reasons for converting XML to Markdown include the need for a more human-readable and portable format, simplifying the editing process, and improving the accessibility of the content.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in XML to MD Conversion?</h2>

By using the powerful [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) suite, converting XML files to MD is made easy and efficient for .NET developers. This package provides a wide range of APIs that can handle various document formats, including XML and MD. The conversion process can be easily integrated into various .NET applications, including C#, ASP.NET, and VB.NET, to streamline workflows and enhance productivity. <br><br>

The conversion process is performed in two steps. Firstly, the [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) is used to export the XML file to XLSX format, which ensures the preservation of the original content and layout. Next, the [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) Spreadsheet Programming API can be utilized to convert the XLSX file to MD. This step allows developers to extract the data and reformat it into markdown syntax while retaining its structure and organization.

If your XML document is password protected, you cannot convert it to MD without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it.  In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and pass the filename and password as arguments.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert XML File to MD with Watermark via C#" %}}
While converting XML file to MD, you can also add watermark to your output MD file format. In order to add a watermark, you can create a new Workbook object and open the converted XLSX document, select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its AddTextEffect function. After that you can save your XLSX document as MD with Watermark.
