Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to easily convert PCL files to DIF within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET applications. The process involves two steps, the first of which is to export the PCL file to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This component provides a wide range of features that enable developers to manipulate PDF documents in a variety of ways. It can be used to create, edit, convert, and print PDF documents, as well as to extract text, images, and other content from them. 

Once the PCL file has been converted to XLSX, the second step is to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to convert the XLSX file to DIF. This component provides a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert spreadsheets in a variety of formats, including XLSX, XLS, CSV, and ODS. It also provides features such as data validation, conditional formatting, and charting, as well as the ability to read and write data from a variety of sources, including databases and web services.

If your PCL document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it.  In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and pass the filename and password as arguments.

While converting PCL file to DIF, you can also add watermark to your output DIF file format. In order to add a watermark, you can create a new Workbook object and open the converted XLSX document, select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its AddTextEffect function. After that you can save your XLSX document as DIF with Watermark.
