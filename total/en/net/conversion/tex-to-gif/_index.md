Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides powerful document manipulation and conversion features for .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which enables developers to convert TEX file formats to DOC. This is followed by the Aspose.Words for .NET API, which allows developers to render DOC to GIF.

The Aspose.PDF for .NET API is a powerful PDF processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to create PDF documents from scratch, edit existing PDF documents, and convert PDF documents to other file formats. It also supports the conversion of TEX file formats to DOC, allowing developers to easily convert documents from one format to another.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt TEX File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting TEX to GIF, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the TEX using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.tex", "password");
// decrypt TEX
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly GIF- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your GIF from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Gif
document.Save("output.gif", SaveFormat.Gif);
