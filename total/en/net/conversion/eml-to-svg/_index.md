1. Open EML file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage) class
2. Convert EML to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mailmessage/save/methods/3) method
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class 
4. Save the document to SVG format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.document/save/methods/4) method and set Svg as SaveFormat

// save EML as a HTML 
message.Save("HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions.DefaultHtml);
// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Svg

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EML File via .NET" %}}
Before converting EML to SVG, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EML document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// instantiate MapiMessage to load an EML file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.eml");
// check for SenderName 
if(outlookMessageFile.SenderName == "John"){
    //proceed with conversion process
}
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict SVG Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to SVG, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Svg
document.Save("output.svg", SaveFormat.Svg);  
```

**EML (Electronic Mail) Files are used to store text-based messages, making them ideal for sending and receiving emails. However, when working with graphical data, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files become essential for creating scalable and resolution-independent graphics.

The conversion of EML files into SVG formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your graphical data visualization and analysis capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Web Graphic Design**: Convert EML files to create vector-based web graphics, logos, and icons that scale with different screen resolutions.
*   **Desktop Publishing**: Use SVG to visualize complex graphical data, such as charts, graphs, and infographics, in publications and presentations.
*   **Mobile App Development**: Convert EML files to create scalable graphics and illustrations for mobile apps, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
*   **E-learning Content Creation**: Use SVG to create interactive and engaging visualizations for e-learning content, such as animated tutorials and simulations.
*   **Data Visualization and Reporting**: Convert EML files to create interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations for stakeholders, enabling better decision-making.
