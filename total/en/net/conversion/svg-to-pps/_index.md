Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily convert SVG to PPS in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the SVG file format into PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features such as the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also supports a variety of file formats, including SVG. 

Once the SVG file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPS. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and converting presentations. It supports a variety of file formats, including PPTX and PPS. It also provides a range of features for manipulating presentations, such as adding text, images, and shapes. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily and quickly convert SVG to PPS in two simple steps. First, use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the SVG file format into PPTX. Then, use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPS. This package of File Format Automation APIs provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and converting documents and presentations.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from SVG File via .NET" %}}
While converting SVG to PPS, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a SVG file’s XMP metadata. To get a SVG file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input SVG file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open SVG document
Document doc = new Document("input.svg");
// get SVG XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPS File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPS file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPS read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pps
presentation.Save("output.pps", SaveFormat.Pps);
