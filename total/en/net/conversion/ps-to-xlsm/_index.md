Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily create, manipulate and convert various file formats within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET applications. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to convert a PostScript (PS) file to an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (XLSM) file.

The process of converting a PS file to XLSM involves two steps. Firstly, using Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can export the PS file to an Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (XLSX) file. This is done by using the Document.Save method, which allows you to save the document in a variety of formats, including XLSX.

Once the PS file has been converted to XLSX, you can then use Aspose.Cells for .NET to convert the XLSX file to XLSM. Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful spreadsheet programming API that enables developers to create, manipulate and convert spreadsheets in a variety of formats, including XLSM. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to convert XLSX to XLSM.

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily convert a PS file to XLSM within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET applications. The process involves two steps: exporting the PS file to XLSX using Aspose.PDF for .NET, and then converting the XLSX file to XLSM using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Both components are included in the Aspose.Total for .NET suite, making it easy to convert PS to XLSM within any .NET application.

If your PS document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLSM without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it.  In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and pass the filename and password as arguments.
