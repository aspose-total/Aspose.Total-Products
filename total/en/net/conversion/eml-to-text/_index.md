Before converting EML to TEXT, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EML document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict TEXT Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to TEXT, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Text
document.Save("output.text", SaveFormat.Text);  
```

EML (Electronic Mail) files are used to store text-based communication information, making them ideal for creating readable messages and emails. However, when working with multimedia content, documents like PDFs become essential for sharing and viewing.

The conversion of EML files into Text formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your message content and analysis capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Message Analysis**: Convert EML files to analyze email messages, track sender behavior, and identify patterns in communication.
*   **Email Marketing Automation**: Use Text formats to visualize email marketing data, automate campaigns, and measure open rates.
*   **Customer Support Documentation**: Convert EML files to create readable documentation, FAQs, and knowledge bases for customers, enabling better support services.
*   **Historical Record Keeping**: Use Text formats to store and retrieve historical email records, ensuring compliance with regulations and record-keeping requirements.
*   **Content Repurposing**: Convert EML files to create shareable content, such as blog posts, social media updates, and press releases, for better engagement and reach.
