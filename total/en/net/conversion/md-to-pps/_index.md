{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from MD File via .NET" %}}
While converting MD to PPS, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a MD file’s XMP metadata. To get a MD file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input MD file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open MD document
Document doc = new Document("input.md");
// get MD XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPS File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPS file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPS read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pps
presentation.Save("output.pps", SaveFormat.Pps);
