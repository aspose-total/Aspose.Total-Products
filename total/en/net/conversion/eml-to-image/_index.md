Before converting EML to IMAGE, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EML document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict IMAGE Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to IMAGE, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Png
document.Save("output.png", SaveFormat.Png);  
```

EML (Electronic Mail) files are used to store text-based emails, making them ideal for creating static email content. However, when working with dynamic images and graphics, formats like JPEG or PNG become essential for visual communication.

The conversion of EML files into image formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your visual communication capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Social Media Content Creation**: Convert EML files to create engaging social media posts, images, and graphics that capture users' attention.
*   **E-commerce Product Showcase**: Use image formats to display product information, features, and benefits in a visually appealing way.
*   **Digital Marketing Campaigns**: Convert EML files to create eye-catching email marketing campaigns, promotional materials, and sales pages.
*   **Blog and Article Illustrations**: Use image formats to illustrate complex blog posts, articles, and whitepapers with engaging visuals.
