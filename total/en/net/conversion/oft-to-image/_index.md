As a .NET developer, you may need to add features to your applications that allow for the conversion of OFT files to IMAGE. Fortunately, Aspose.Total for .NET provides a comprehensive set of file format manipulation APIs that make this process easy.

Aspose.Email for .NET is the first step in the conversion process. This API allows you to convert OFT files to HTML. This is done by using the MailMessage.Load method, which takes an OFT file as an input and returns a MailMessage object. Once you have the MailMessage object, you can use the MailMessage.Save method to save the message as an HTML file.

The next step is to use Aspose.Words for .NET to render the HTML file to an IMAGE. This is done by using the Document.Load method, which takes an HTML file as an input and returns a Document object. Once you have the Document object, you can use the Document.Save method to save the document as an IMAGE file.

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily convert OFT files to IMAGE. Aspose.Email for .NET is used to convert OFT files to HTML, and Aspose.Words for .NET is used to render the HTML file to an IMAGE. With these APIs, you can quickly and easily add OFT to IMAGE conversion features to your .NET applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse OFT File via .NET" %}}
Before converting OFT to IMAGE, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load OFT document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// instantiate MapiMessage to load an OFT file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.oft");
// check for SenderName 
if(outlookMessageFile.SenderName == "John"){
    //proceed with conversion process
}
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict IMAGE Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from OFT to IMAGE, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Png
document.Save("output.png", SaveFormat.Png);  
```
