<h2 class="heading-border">What is Web Scrapping?</h2>

<p>Web scraping, also referred to as web harvesting, data scraping, web data extraction, or web crawling, is a technique used to extract data from websites. It involves the automated process of retrieving specific information from web pages by utilizing specialized software or tools.</p><br />
<p>Web scraping software or scripts are designed to simulate human browsing behavior and interact with websites to gather data. These tools send HTTP requests to web servers, retrieve the HTML or XML responses, and then extract the desired data elements from the retrieved content.</p><br />

<p>The extracted data can include various types of information such as text, images, tables, links, prices, product details, reviews, and more, depending on the specific requirements. The extracted data is typically saved in a structured format, such as DOC, DOCX, CSV, JSON, or a database, for further analysis, storage, or integration with other systems.</p><br />

<p>Web scraping has numerous applications and is used across various industries. It can be employed for market research, competitive analysis, sentiment analysis, price monitoring, data aggregation, content scraping, lead generation, and much more.</p><br />

<p>However, it's important to note that web scraping should be conducted responsibly and ethically. It's essential to respect the terms of service of websites, comply with legal regulations, and not engage in activities that may violate privacy or intellectual property rights.</p>

<h2 class="heading-border">Using Aspose.HTML as a Web Scrapping API</h2>

<p>With the help of the [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API, a child API of [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/), you can effortlessly develop your own applications that involve analyzing and extracting information from HTML documents. The API offers a robust toolset that facilitates this process.</p><br />

<p>When building a scraper, data selectors play a crucial role in identifying and extracting the desired information from HTML files. Typically, these selectors utilize XPath, CSS selectors, or a combination of both to locate the specific data elements within the HTML structure. These selectors act as a means to navigate through the document and pinpoint the data you intend to extract.</p>
