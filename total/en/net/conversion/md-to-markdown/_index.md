{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt MD File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting MD to MARKDOWN, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the MD using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly MARKDOWN- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your MARKDOWN from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Markdown
document.Save("output.markdown", SaveFormat.Markdown);    
```

Conversion of Markdown Files into Markdown Format

Markdown files are used to store plain text information, making them ideal for creating simple documents and notes. However, when working with more structured data, HTML becomes essential for content visualization and analysis.

The conversion of Markdown files into HTML formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your content visualization and analysis capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Blog Post Publishing**: Convert Markdown files to publish blog posts on websites, blogs, or online platforms, making them easily accessible to readers.
*   **Documentation Creation**: Use HTML to create interactive documentation for software applications, making it easier for users to understand the product's features and functionality.
*   **Wiki Development**: Convert Markdown files to create collaborative wikis, enabling teams to work together on content creation and maintenance.
*   **Technical Writing**: Use HTML to create technical documents, such as user manuals and instructional guides, that provide clear explanations of complex concepts.
*   **Content Marketing**: Convert Markdown files to create engaging content for marketing campaigns, such as landing pages, sales pages, and product descriptions.
