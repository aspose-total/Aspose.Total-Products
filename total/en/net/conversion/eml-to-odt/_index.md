Before converting EML to ODT, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EML document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict ODT Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to ODT, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Odt
document.Save("output.odt", SaveFormat.Odt);  
```

EML (Electronic Mail) files are used to store text-based email content, making them ideal for creating simple, plain text emails. However, when working with more advanced document features, OpenDocument Text (.odt) formats become essential for editing and formatting.

The conversion of EML files into ODT formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your document editing and formatting capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Content Editing**: Convert EML files to edit content, format text, and add multimedia elements.
*   **Document Collaboration**: Use ODT to collaborate with others in real-time, share documents, and track changes.
*   **Template Creation**: Convert EML files to create reusable templates for consistent branding and messaging.
*   **Accessibility Enhancements**: Use ODT to improve document accessibility, adding features like font size adjustment and high contrast modes.
*   **Integration with Other Tools**: Convert EML files to integrate with other office software, such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word, for seamless workflow.
