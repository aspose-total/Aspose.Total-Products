Before converting EMAIL to WORDML, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EMAIL document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict WORDML Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMAIL to WORDML, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.WordML
document.Save("output.wordml", SaveFormat.WordML);  
```

Email files are used to store text-based communication information, making them ideal for sending messages to recipients. However, when working with presentation data, WordML (Word Markup Language) files become essential for creating professional-looking documents and presentations.

The conversion of email files into WordML formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your document creation and presentation capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Business Correspondence**: Convert email files to create formal business reports, proposals, and meeting minutes.
*   **Presentation Design**: Use WordML to design engaging presentations, add multimedia elements, and include interactive features.
*   **Document Templates**: Convert email files to create reusable templates for frequently used documents, such as contracts and policies.
*   **Research Collaboration**: Use WordML to share research findings, collaborate with colleagues, and track progress.
*   **Marketing Content Creation**: Convert email files to create promotional materials, social media posts, and blog articles.

By converting your emails into WordML format, you can unlock new possibilities for document creation, presentation design, and collaboration.
