{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt EPUB File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting EPUB to FLATOPC, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the EPUB using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly FLATOPC- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your FLATOPC from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");

document.Save("output.flatopc", SaveFormat.FlatOpc);    
```

Converting Epub Files to Flat OPC: Unlocking Enhanced Data Visualization and Analysis Capabilities

Epub (Electronic Publication) files are widely used for storing and distributing digital content, including e-books, articles, and documents. However, when working with data-intensive projects, spreadsheets like Excel become indispensable for data visualization and analysis.

The conversion of Epub files into Flat OPC formats is crucial to unlock the full potential of your data visualization and analysis capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Business Intelligence and Data Analysis**: Convert Epub files to analyze business data, track market trends, and identify patterns in data.
*   **Scientific Research and Publication**: Use Flat OPC formats to visualize complex scientific data, such as 3D models, simulation results, and experimental data.
*   **Education and Academic Publishing**: Convert Epub files to create interactive educational materials, simulate student experiences, and validate learning concepts.
*   **Data Reporting and Dashboarding**: Use Flat OPC formats to create interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations for stakeholders, enabling better decision-making.
*   **Marketing and Sales Analysis**: Convert Epub files to analyze customer behavior, track sales trends, and optimize marketing strategies.
