{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOTM Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMAIL to DOTM, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Dotm
document.Save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.Dotm);  
```

Email to DOTM Conversion: Unlocking Your Email Data's Full Potential

Email files are ideal for storing simple messages, but they lack the sophistication required for more complex data analysis and visualization. On the other hand, Microsoft Office Document Templates (.DOTM) offer a versatile platform for creating engaging reports, dashboards, and visualizations.

Converting email files to DOTM formats is essential to unlock your email data's full potential. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Sales Performance Analysis**: Convert email files to analyze sales trends, track customer interactions, and identify opportunities for growth.
*   **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Use DOTM templates to visualize customer feedback, sentiment analysis, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) tracking.
*   **Marketing Campaign Monitoring**: Convert email files to monitor marketing campaign performance, measure ROI, and optimize strategies.
*   **Compliance Reporting**: Use DOTM templates to generate compliance reports, track regulatory requirements, and ensure adherence to industry standards.
*   **Data Visualization and Dashboarding**: Convert email files to create interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations for stakeholders, enabling better decision-making.

By converting your email data to DOTM formats, you can elevate your analysis capabilities, streamline reporting processes, and drive business growth.
