Before converting EML to JPEG, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EML document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict JPEG Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to JPEG, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Jpeg
document.Save("output.jpeg", SaveFormat.Jpeg);  
```

EML (Electronic Mail) files are used to store text-based messages, making them ideal for creating simple visualizations of email content, such as previews or snippets. However, when working with visually appealing graphics and multimedia elements, JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) images become essential for sharing and presenting data.

The conversion of EML files into JPEG formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your data presentation and sharing capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Email Marketing Campaigns**: Convert EML files to create visually appealing email campaigns, including image previews, social media posts, and content snippets.
*   **Newsletters and Blogs**: Use JPEG to showcase email newsletters and blog articles, making them more engaging for readers.
*   **Social Media Sharing**: Convert EML files to share email content on social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, with visually appealing images.
*   **Email Client Integration**: Convert EML files to create custom email clients with visually appealing interfaces and user experiences.
*   **Data Presentation and Reporting**: Use JPEG to present data in a more engaging way, making it easier for stakeholders to understand complex information.
