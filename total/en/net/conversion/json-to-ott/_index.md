While parsing JSON to OTT, you can also set layout options for your JSON using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.
