Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to parse JSON to WMF within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. It provides a simple two-step process to achieve this. 

The first step is to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to export JSON to JPEG. This component is a powerful spreadsheet processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert and render spreadsheets. It supports a wide range of formats, including JSON, and can be used to export JSON to JPEG with ease. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to WMF. This component is a powerful image processing API that enables developers to create, edit, convert and render images. It supports a wide range of formats, including JPEG and WMF, and can be used to convert JPEG to WMF with ease. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily parse JSON to WMF within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. It provides a simple two-step process that involves using Aspose.Cells for .NET to export JSON to JPEG and Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to WMF. This makes it an ideal solution for developers who need to parse JSON to WMF quickly and easily.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) object and read JSON data from file
2. Convert JSON to JPEG using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.workbook/save/methods/4) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to WMF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to WMF via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to WMF, you can also set layout options for your JSON using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse JSON Format to WMF with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to WMF with watermark in your WMF document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your JSON document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark to it, you can save the JPEG as WMF format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.
