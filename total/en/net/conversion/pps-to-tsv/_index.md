PSF (Portable Document Format) files are used to store layout information, making them ideal for creating professional documents and presentations. However, when working with data-driven content, text files like TSV (Tab Separated Values) become essential for data analysis and manipulation.

The conversion of PSF files into TSV formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your data analysis and manipulation capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Convert PSF files to analyze and visualize data, track trends, and identify patterns in content.
*   **Content Reporting and Dashboarding**: Use TSV to create interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations for stakeholders, enabling better decision-making.
*   **Automated Processing and Integration**: Convert PSF files to automate processing and integration of data, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.
*   **Export for Data Science Tools**: Use TSV to export content for use with popular data science tools, such as Python libraries and R packages.
*   **Format-Agnostic Content Management**: Convert PSF files to format-agnostic content management systems, enabling flexible and adaptable content delivery.
