Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily export MD to WMZ image within any .NET applications. It consists of two powerful APIs, Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, that can be used to perform the conversion in two simple steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export MD to JPEG. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and printing. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and WMZ. With this API, you can easily convert MD to JPEG with just a few lines of code. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to WMZ. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for image processing, such as resizing, cropping, rotating, and flipping. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and WMZ. With this API, you can easily convert JPEG to WMZ with just a few lines of code. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily export MD to WMZ image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. First, you can use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export MD to JPEG. Then, you can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to WMZ. With this comprehensive suite of APIs, you can easily perform the conversion with just a few lines of code.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render MD to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to WMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with .NET File Automation APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total``` or install directly from Package Manager Console of Visual Studio.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/net).

Using the API, you can also convert MD file to WMZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your MD document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to WMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to WMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert MD to WMZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert MD file to WMZ with watermark in your WMZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your MD document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as WMZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate MD File to WMZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output WMZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
