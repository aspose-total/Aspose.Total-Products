Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides developers with the ability to add document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications. It includes powerful PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, which enables developers to convert XPS file format to DOC. This is followed by the Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for .NET, which allows developers to render DOC to XAMLFLOW. 

The Aspose.PDF for .NET API provides a wide range of features that enable developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It supports a variety of file formats, including XPS, DOC, and XAMLFLOW. It also provides features such as text extraction, document merging, and page manipulation. Additionally, it supports the conversion of PDF documents to other file formats, such as HTML, XPS, and DOC.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt XPS File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting XPS to XAMLFLOW, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the XPS using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.xps", "password");
// decrypt XPS
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly XAMLFLOW- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your XAMLFLOW from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xamlflow
document.Save("output.xamlflow", SaveFormat.Xamlflow);
