Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides powerful document manipulation and conversion features for .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which enables developers to convert MD file format to DOC. This API is equipped with advanced PDF processing capabilities, such as text extraction, image extraction, page manipulation, and more. 

Once the MD file is converted to DOC, the Aspose.Words for .NET API can be used to render the DOC file to RTF. This API provides a wide range of features for document processing, such as document conversion, document comparison, document merging, document splitting, and more. It also supports a variety of document formats, including DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML, and more. 

In addition to the document manipulation and conversion features, Aspose.Total for .NET also includes APIs for other tasks, such as email processing, barcode generation, and image processing. With these APIs, developers can easily add features such as email sending, barcode recognition, and image manipulation to their .NET applications. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful suite of APIs that provides a comprehensive set of features for document manipulation and conversion. It includes APIs for converting MD file format to DOC, rendering DOC to RTF, email processing, barcode generation, and image processing. With these APIs, developers can easily add powerful document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt MD File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting MD to RTF, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the MD using the owner’s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly RTF- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your RTF from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Rtf
document.Save("output.rtf", SaveFormat.Rtf);
