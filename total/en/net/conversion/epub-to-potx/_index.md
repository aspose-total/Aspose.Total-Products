Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily render EPUB to POTX in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the EPUB file format into PPTX. This API provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, such as converting, merging, splitting, and extracting text and images. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to POTX. This API provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate presentations, such as creating, editing, and converting presentations. It also supports a variety of presentation formats, including PPTX, POTX, PPT, PPS, PPSX, and POT. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can quickly and easily render EPUB to POTX in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, can be used to transform the EPUB file format into PPTX. Then, the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert the PPTX to POTX. This package of File Format Automation APIs provides a range of features that make it easy to manipulate documents and presentations.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert EPUB to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Potx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from EPUB File via .NET" %}}
While converting EPUB to POTX, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a EPUB file’s XMP metadata. To get a EPUB file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input EPUB file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("input.epub");
// get EPUB XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only POTX File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your POTX file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make POTX read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Potx
presentation.Save("output.potx", SaveFormat.Potx);
