Firstly, Excel provides a structured and organized format for tabular data, allowing you to efficiently analyze and manipulate the data within cells and columns. By converting XML to Excel, you can extract and transform data from the XML file into a spreadsheet, making it easier to work with and perform calculations or analysis on the data. Additionally, Excel offers advanced features such as sorting, filtering, and data validation, which can enhance data management and analysis tasks. Furthermore, Excel provides powerful charting and visualization capabilities, allowing you to create visual representations of the data from the XML file. This can be particularly useful for presenting and communicating information in a more visually appealing manner.
