Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily convert MHTML to PPSM in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the MHTML file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and merging PDFs. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPSM. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and converting presentations. It also supports a wide range of presentation formats, including PPTX, PPT, PPSX, PPS, POTX, POT, and PPTM.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from MHTML File via .NET" %}}
While converting MHTML to PPSM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a MHTML file’s XMP metadata. To get a MHTML file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input MHTML file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open MHTML document
Document doc = new Document("input.mhtml");
// get MHTML XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPSM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPSM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPSM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsm
presentation.Save("output.ppsm", SaveFormat.Ppsm);
