{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-summary %}}
Using a package of powerful File Format Automation APIs [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can easily Render MHTML to PPSM in two simple steps. By using PDF Processing API [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/), you can transform MHTML file format to PPTX. After that, by using Presentation Processing API [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/), you can convert PPTX to PPSM.

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert MHTML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPSM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Ppsm` as SaveFormat

// save MHTML as a PPTX 
document.Save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsm
presentation.Save("output.ppsm", SaveFormat.Ppsm);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from MHTML File via .NET" %}}
While converting MHTML to PPSM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a MHTML file’s XMP metadata. To get a MHTML file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input MHTML file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open MHTML document
Document doc = new Document("input.mhtml");
// get MHTML XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPSM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPSM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPSM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsm
presentation.Save("output.ppsm", SaveFormat.Ppsm);
