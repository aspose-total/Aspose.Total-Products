1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from PS File via .NET" %}}
While converting PS to XAML, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a PS file’s XMP metadata. To get a PS file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input PS file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only XAML File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your XAML file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make XAML read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xaml
presentation.Save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

PS (Portable Document Format) files are used to store vector graphics information, making them ideal for creating static graphics, logos, and illustrations. However, when working with dynamic data, XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) becomes essential for building user interfaces and applications.

The conversion of PS files into XAML formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your application development capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Mobile App Development**: Convert PS files to create native mobile apps with intuitive user interfaces, leveraging the power of XAML for a seamless user experience.
*   **Desktop Application Development**: Use XAML to build robust and scalable desktop applications, taking advantage of the language's strengths in data binding, animations, and templating.
*   **UI Component Libraries**: Convert PS files to create reusable UI components, such as buttons, text fields, and menus, using XAML for efficient and maintainable design.
*   **3D Graphics and Animation**: Use XAML to bring 3D graphics and animations to life in your applications, combining the power of vector graphics with the flexibility of a markup language.
*   **Accessibility and Customization**: Convert PS files to create accessible and customizable UI elements, ensuring that your applications cater to diverse user needs and preferences.
