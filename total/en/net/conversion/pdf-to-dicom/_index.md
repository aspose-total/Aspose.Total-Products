<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert PDF to DICOM format via .NET?</h2>

Converting PDF to DICOM format via .NET is essential for the medical field as it allows medical professionals to integrate and manage critical patient information and images within Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). This conversion ensures compatibility, easy sharing, and long-term storage of medical data, making it accessible for diagnosis, treatment, and research, ultimately improving patient care and healthcare efficiency.

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in PDF to DICOM Conversion?</h2>

Using [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can easily export PDF to DICOM image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. First of all, by using [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/), you can export PDF to JPEG. After that, by using [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net/) Image Processing API, you can convert JPEG to DICOM.

1. Open PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render PDF to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to DICOM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF File to DICOM in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to DICOM to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PDF document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to DICOM. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to DICOM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF to DICOM With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to DICOM with watermark in your DICOM document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your PDF document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as DICOM format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PDF File to DICOM via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output DICOM image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
