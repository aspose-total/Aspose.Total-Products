While parsing JSON to FLATOPC, you can also set layout options for your JSON using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to FLATOPC with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your FLATOPC document, you can first parse JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.SetText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions.
