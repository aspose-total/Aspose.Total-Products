Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to add powerful document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which allows developers to convert PostScript (PS) files to Microsoft Word (DOC) format. After conversion, the Aspose.Words for .NET API can be used to render the DOC file to OpenDocument Text (ODT) format.

The Aspose.PDF for .NET API provides a wide range of features for manipulating PDF documents, including the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF files. It also supports the conversion of PDF files to other popular document formats, such as HTML, XPS, and SVG. The API also provides features for extracting text and images from PDF documents, as well as for adding annotations, watermarks, and digital signatures.

The Aspose.Words for .NET API is a powerful document processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert documents in a variety of formats, including DOC, DOCX, ODT, and HTML. It also provides features for rendering documents to PDF, XPS, and other popular formats. The API also supports the conversion of documents to and from HTML, as well as the extraction of text and images from documents.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt PS File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting PS to ODT, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the PS using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.ps", "password");
// decrypt PS
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly ODT- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your ODT from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Odt
document.Save("output.odt", SaveFormat.Odt);
