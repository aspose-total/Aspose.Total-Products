Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily convert CGM to PPSX in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the CGM file format into PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert between different file formats. 

Once the CGM file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPSX. This API provides a comprehensive set of features that allow you to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert between different file formats.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from CGM File via .NET" %}}
While converting CGM to PPSX, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a CGM file’s XMP metadata. To get a CGM file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input CGM file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPSX File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPSX file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPSX read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsx
presentation.Save("output.ppsx", SaveFormat.Ppsx);     
```
