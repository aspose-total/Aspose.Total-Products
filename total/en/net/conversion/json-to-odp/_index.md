Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily convert JSON to ODP within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. This package includes two APIs, Aspose.Cells for .NET and Aspose.Slides for .NET, which can be used to parse JSON to PPTX and then convert PPTX to ODP respectively. 

The process of converting JSON to ODP involves two simple steps. Firstly, you need to parse JSON to PPTX using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This API provides a wide range of features to parse JSON to PPTX. It supports various JSON formats such as JSON, JSON5, and BSON. It also provides the ability to parse JSON to PPTX with a single line of code. 

Once you have parsed JSON to PPTX, you can use Aspose.Slides for .NET to convert PPTX to ODP. This API provides a wide range of features to convert PPTX to ODP. It supports various ODP formats such as ODP, OTP, and OTPX. It also provides the ability to convert PPTX to ODP with a single line of code. 

In conclusion, Aspose.Total for .NET provides an easy and efficient way to convert JSON to ODP within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. It includes two APIs, Aspose.Cells for .NET and Aspose.Slides for .NET, which can be used to parse JSON to PPTX and then convert PPTX to ODP respectively.

2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonutility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.workbook/save/methods/4) it as PPTX 
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to ODP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to ODP via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to ODP, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

Using the API, you can also convert JSON to ODP with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your ODP document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class, select the master presentation, add shape type using AddAutoShape, and add watermark text using AddTextFrame. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to ODP.
