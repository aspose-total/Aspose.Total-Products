Converting JSON to PPSM within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) to parse the JSON into a PPTX file. The second step is to use [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) to convert the PPTX file into a PPSM file. Both of these APIs are part of the [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) package.

Using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can easily parse JSON into a PPTX file. The API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write data from and to various file formats, including JSON, Excel, and PowerPoint. It also provides support for various features, such as formatting, charts, and pivot tables.

Once the JSON has been parsed into a PPTX file, Aspose.Slides for .NET can be used to convert the PPTX file into a PPSM file. This API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write data from and to various file formats, including PPTX, PPSM, and PPT. It also provides support for various features, such as animations, transitions, and shapes.

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily convert JSON to PPSM within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to PPSM via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to PPSM, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PPSM with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPSM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPSM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class, select the master presentation, add shape type using AddAutoShape, and add watermark text using AddTextFrame. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to PPSM.
