[Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) also allows you to load RTF document via stream. To open a document from a stream, simply pass a stream object that contains the document into the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) constructor. The following code example shows how to open a document from a stream:

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Custom Properties in XLTX File via C#" %}}
While converting RTF to XLTX, [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) enables you to add custom properties in your XLTX documents. In order to add a custom property, you can use [Add](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/customdocumentpropertycollection/methods/add/index) method for the [CustomDocumentPropertyCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/customdocumentpropertycollection) class. The Add method adds the property to the Excel file and returns a reference for the new document property as an [Aspose.Cells.Properties.DocumentProperty](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/documentproperty) object.
