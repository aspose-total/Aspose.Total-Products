While converting WORD to TSV, [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) enables you to add custom properties in your TSV documents. In order to add a custom property, you can use [Add](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/customdocumentpropertycollection/methods/add/index) method for the [CustomDocumentPropertyCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/customdocumentpropertycollection) class. The Add method adds the property to the Excel file and returns a reference for the new document property as an [Aspose.Cells.Properties.DocumentProperty](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/documentproperty) object.
