{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOCX Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to DOCX, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Docx
document.Save("output.docx", SaveFormat.Docx);  
```

EML (Electronic Mail) files are used to store text-based messages, making them ideal for sending and receiving emails. However, when working with documents that require formatting and presentation, Microsoft Word (.docx) becomes the preferred choice.

The conversion of EML files into .docx formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your document editing capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Business Communication**: Convert EML files to create professional-looking documents, such as meeting notes, project updates, and business proposals.
*   **Personal Correspondence**: Use Word to format and edit personal emails, letters, and messages, ensuring a polished and readable tone.
*   **Meeting Notes and Minutes**: Convert EML files to create detailed and organized meeting notes and minutes, facilitating accurate record-keeping and follow-up actions.
*   **Proposal and Contract Writing**: Use Word to draft and edit proposals, contracts, and agreements, ensuring clarity, concision, and professionalism.
*   **Research and Academic Writing**: Convert EML files to create formatted research papers, articles, and theses, enabling easier editing and collaboration.
