{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict WORDML Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to WORDML, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.WordML
document.Save("output.wordml", SaveFormat.WordML);  
```

EML (Electronic Mail) files are used to store plain text messages, making them ideal for simple email communication. However, when working with document-based data, WordML (Word Markup Language) becomes essential for formatting and styling.

The conversion of EML files into WordML formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your document editing and publishing capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Document Editing and Publishing**: Convert EML files to edit and publish documents, ensuring consistent formatting and styles.
*   **Email Templates and Resumes**: Use WordML to create professional-looking email templates and resumes, showcasing your skills and experience.
*   **Report Generation and Publishing**: Convert EML files to generate reports and publications, including articles, whitepapers, and more.
*   **Marketing Campaign Materials**: Use WordML to create marketing campaign materials, such as brochures, flyers, and social media content.
*   **Academic and Research Writing**: Convert EML files to format academic and research papers, theses, and dissertations, ensuring proper citation and referencing.
