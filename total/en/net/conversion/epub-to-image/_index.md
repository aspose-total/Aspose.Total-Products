Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export EPUB to IMAGE image within any .NET applications. This suite of components provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to export EPUB to JPEG and convert JPEG to IMAGE.

The process of exporting EPUB to IMAGE image is simple and straightforward. First, you need to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export EPUB to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to convert EPUB to JPEG in a few simple steps. Once the EPUB has been converted to JPEG, you can then use Aspose.Imaging for .NET Image Processing API to convert JPEG to IMAGE. This component provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to convert JPEG to IMAGE in a few simple steps.

Once the EPUB has been converted to IMAGE, you can then use the image in any .NET application. This makes it easy to create applications that can use images in a variety of ways, such as displaying them on a website or using them in a document.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to IMAGE to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to IMAGE. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to JPEG2000 format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to IMAGE With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to IMAGE with watermark in your IMAGE document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your EPUB document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate EPUB File to IMAGE via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output IMAGE image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
