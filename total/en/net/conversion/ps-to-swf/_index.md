{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-summary %}}
Using a package of powerful File Format Automation APIs [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can easily Render PS to SWF in two simple steps. By using PDF Processing API [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/), you can transform PS file format to PPTX. After that, by using Presentation Processing API [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/), you can convert PPTX to SWF.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

// save PS as a PPTX 
document.Save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Swf
presentation.Save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from PS File via .NET" %}}
While converting PS to SWF, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a PS file’s XMP metadata. To get a PS file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input PS file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open PS document
Document doc = new Document("input.ps");
// get PS XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only SWF File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your SWF file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make SWF read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Swf
presentation.Save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);
