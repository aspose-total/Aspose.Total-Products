{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict XPS Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMLX to XPS, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xps
document.Save("output.xps", SaveFormat.Xps);  
```

EMLX (Electronic Messaging Layer with Extensions) files are used to store plain text information, making them ideal for sending emails and exchanging business messages. However, when working with image-based data, XPS (XML Paper Specification) documents become essential for printing and sharing visual content.

The conversion of EMLX files into XPS formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your document sharing and printing capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Document Sharing**: Convert EMLX files to share documents, reports, and presentations with colleagues and clients, ensuring accurate and secure exchange.
*   **Print Optimization**: Use XPS to optimize print layouts, images, and designs for better visual quality and reduced file sizes.
*   **Image Editing and Enhancement**: Convert EMLX files to edit and enhance image content, including graphics, photographs, and illustrations.
*   **Digital Signature Integration**: Use XPS to integrate digital signatures, ensuring secure authentication and verification of documents.
*   **Accessibility and Inclusion**: Convert EMLX files to create accessible and inclusive documents, following web accessibility standards for better readability.
