Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to Render PS to OTP in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the PS file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents in various ways, such as converting, creating, editing, and merging them. 

Once the PS file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to OTP. This API provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and manipulating presentations in various formats, such as PPTX, PPT, ODP, OTP, and more. It also allows you to convert presentations from one format to another, such as from PPTX to OTP.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from PS File via .NET" %}}
While converting PS to OTP, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a PS file’s XMP metadata. To get a PS file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input PS file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only OTP File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your OTP file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make OTP read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Otp
presentation.Save("output.otp", SaveFormat.Otp);
