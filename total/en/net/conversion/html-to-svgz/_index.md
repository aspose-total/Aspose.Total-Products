Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export HTML to SVGZ image within any .NET applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are both powerful and feature-rich components. 

Using Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can export HTML to JPEG in just a few simple steps. This component provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to convert HTML to PDF, PDF to HTML, and HTML to JPEG. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP. 

Once the HTML has been converted to JPEG, Aspose.Imaging for .NET can be used to convert the JPEG to SVGZ. This powerful Image Processing API provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to resize, crop, rotate, and flip images. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export HTML to SVGZ image within any .NET applications in just two simple steps. First, HTML is converted to JPEG using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Then, the JPEG is converted to SVGZ using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. This suite of components provides developers with a powerful and feature-rich solution for exporting HTML to SVGZ image within any .NET applications.

1. Open HTML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render HTML to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to SVGZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Using the API, you can also convert HTML file to SVGZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your HTML document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to SVGZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to SVGZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to SVGZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert HTML file to SVGZ with watermark in your SVGZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your HTML document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as SVGZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate HTML File to SVGZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output SVGZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
