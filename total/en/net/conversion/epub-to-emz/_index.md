Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export EPUB to EMZ image within any .NET applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are two powerful components that can be used to perform the conversion. 

The first step in the process is to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export EPUB to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features that make it easy to convert EPUB to JPEG. It supports a variety of formats, including PDF, XPS, EPUB, HTML, and more. It also provides a range of options for customizing the output, such as setting the resolution, page size, and more. 

Once the EPUB has been converted to JPEG, the next step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert the JPEG to EMZ. This component provides a comprehensive set of image processing features that make it easy to convert JPEG to EMZ. It supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and more. It also provides a range of options for customizing the output, such as setting the resolution, color depth, and more. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export EPUB to EMZ image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. First, they can use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export EPUB to JPEG. Then, they can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert the JPEG to EMZ. This suite of components provides a comprehensive set of features that make it easy to perform the conversion quickly and easily.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to EMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB File to EMZ in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to EMZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to EMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to EMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to EMZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to EMZ with watermark in your EMZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your EPUB document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as EMZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate EPUB File to EMZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output EMZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
