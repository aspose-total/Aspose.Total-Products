{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict FLATOPC Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMAIL to FLATOPC, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it.

You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");

document.Save("output.flatopc", SaveFormat.FlatOpc);  
```
