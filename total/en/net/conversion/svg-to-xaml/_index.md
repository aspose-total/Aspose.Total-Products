<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert SVG to XAML format?</h2>

Converting SVG files to XAML can be useful in several scenarios. SVG is a vector-based image format used for creating scalable graphics and icons. XAML is a declarative programming language used to create user interfaces and graphics in Microsoft's .NET framework. Firstly, XAML is a standard format for creating user interfaces in Microsoft's .NET framework. Converting SVG files to XAML can enable developers to integrate vector graphics into their .NET applications and user interfaces. Secondly, XAML offers a wider range of layout and design capabilities compared to SVG. XAML supports animations, gradients, and other advanced design elements, which can enhance the visual appeal of user interfaces and graphics. Thirdly, XAML enables developers to easily customize and manipulate graphics elements programmatically. This makes it easier to create dynamic user interfaces and animations that respond to user input and system events. 

<h2 class="heading-border">How Aspose.Total can help in SVG to XAML Conversion?</h2>

Using a package of powerful File Format Automation APIs [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can easily Render SVG to XAML in two simple steps. You can transform SVG file format to PPTX by using PDF Processing API [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/). Then, by using Presentation Processing API [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/), you can convert PPTX to XAML.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

```cs// load SVG file with an instance of Document class

// save SVG as a PPTX 
document.Save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xaml
presentation.Save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from SVG via .NET" %}}
While converting SVG to XAML, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a SVG file’s XMP metadata. To get a SVG file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input SVG file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open SVG document
Document doc = new Document("input.svg");
// get SVG XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only XAML Files via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your XAML file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make XAML read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xaml
presentation.Save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);
