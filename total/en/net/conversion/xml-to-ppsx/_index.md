Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily render XML to PPSX in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the XML file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and merging PDF files. It also supports a variety of file formats, including XML, HTML, XPS, and PDF. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPSX. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, and manipulate presentations. It supports a variety of file formats, including PPTX, PPSX, PPT, PPS, and ODP. It also provides features such as adding text, images, shapes, and charts to presentations, as well as converting presentations to other file formats. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily render XML to PPSX in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, can be used to transform the XML file format to PPTX. Then, the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert the PPTX to PPSX. This package of File Format Automation APIs provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, as well as convert them to other file formats.

1. Open XML file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPSX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Ppsx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from XML File via .NET" %}}
While converting XML to PPSX, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a XML file’s XMP metadata. To get a XML file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input XML file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml");
// get XML XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPSX File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPSX file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPSX read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsx
presentation.Save("output.ppsx", SaveFormat.Ppsx);
