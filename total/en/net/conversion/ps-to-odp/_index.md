Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily convert PostScript (PS) files to OpenDocument Presentation (ODP) format. This process can be completed in two simple steps. 

The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the PS file format to PowerPoint Presentation (PPTX). This API provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert PDF files to other formats. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX file to ODP. This API provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate presentation documents, including the ability to convert presentation files to other formats. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can quickly and easily convert PS files to ODP format. This package of File Format Automation APIs provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate documents, including the ability to convert files to other formats.

2. Convert PS to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to ODP format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Odp` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from PS File via .NET" %}}
While converting PS to ODP, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a PS file’s XMP metadata. To get a PS file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input PS file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open PS document
Document doc = new Document("input.ps");
// get PS XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only ODP File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your ODP file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make ODP read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Odp
presentation.Save("output.odp", SaveFormat.Odp);
