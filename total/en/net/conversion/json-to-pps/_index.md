Converting JSON to PPS within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) to parse JSON to PPTX. This API is part of the [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) package. The second step is to use [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) to convert PPTX to PPS.

Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful .NET library that enables developers to create, manipulate and convert spreadsheets without requiring Microsoft Excel. It supports a wide range of file formats, including XLS, XLSX, CSV, ODS, HTML, PDF, XPS, and many more. It also provides features such as data validation, worksheet protection, charting, and more.

Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful .NET library that enables developers to create, manipulate and convert presentations without requiring Microsoft PowerPoint. It supports a wide range of file formats, including PPT, PPTX, PPS, PPSX, ODP, HTML, PDF, XPS, and many more. It also provides features such as text formatting, slide transitions, animations, and more.

By using Aspose.Cells for .NET and Aspose.Slides for .NET, developers can easily convert JSON to PPS within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for .NET package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to PPS via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to PPS, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PPS with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPS with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPS document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class, select the master presentation, add shape type using AddAutoShape, and add watermark text using AddTextFrame. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to PPS.
