If your PDF document is password protected, you cannot convert it to DIF without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it.  In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and pass the filename and password as arguments.
