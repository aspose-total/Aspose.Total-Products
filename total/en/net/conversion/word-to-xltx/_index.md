Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input WORD document is password protected, you cannot convert it to XLTX without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

After you convert WORD to XLTX, you can also encrypt and password protect your XLTX documents. In order to encrypt your document, open it using Workbook class and specify XOR Encryption Type and Strong Encryption type (RC4, Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider) encryption by using the SetEncryptionOptions method. You can also set a password to your XLTX by using the Password property of WorkbookSettings class.
