With Aspose.Email for .NET, you can easily convert MSG files to HTML.

Once the MSG file has been converted to HTML, you can use Aspose.Words for .NET to render the HTML to WORDML. Aspose.Words for .NET is a powerful API that enables developers to work with WORDML documents. With Aspose.Words for .NET, you can easily render HTML to WORDML.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse MSG File via .NET" %}}
Before converting MSG to WORDML, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load MSG document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// instantiate MapiMessage to load an MSG file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.msg");
// check for SenderName 
if(outlookMessageFile.SenderName == "John"){
    //proceed with conversion process
}

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict WORDML Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from MSG to WORDML, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.WordML
document.Save("output.wordml", SaveFormat.WordML);
