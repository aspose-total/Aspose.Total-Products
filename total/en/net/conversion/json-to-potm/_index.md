Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily convert JSON to POTM within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. This package includes two powerful APIs, Aspose.Cells for .NET and Aspose.Slides for .NET, which can be used to parse JSON to PPTX and then convert PPTX to POTM respectively.

The process of converting JSON to POTM is quite simple and can be done in two steps. Firstly, you need to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to parse JSON to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to work with spreadsheets, such as creating, editing, and converting spreadsheets. It also supports a variety of formats, including JSON, XLSX, XLS, CSV, ODS, and more.

Once you have parsed JSON to PPTX, you can use Aspose.Slides for .NET to convert PPTX to POTM. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to work with presentations, such as creating, editing, and converting presentations. It also supports a variety of formats, including PPTX, PPT, POTX, POT, ODP, and more.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to POTM via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to POTM, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to POTM with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to POTM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your POTM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class, select the master presentation, add shape type using AddAutoShape, and add watermark text using AddTextFrame. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to POTM.
