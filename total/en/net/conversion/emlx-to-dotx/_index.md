Before converting EMLX to DOTX, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EMLX document, parse it and have a look at your desired property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// instantiate MapiMessage to load an EMLX file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.emlx");
// check for SenderName

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict DOTX Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMLX to DOTX, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Dotx
document.Save("output.dotx", SaveFormat.Dotx);
