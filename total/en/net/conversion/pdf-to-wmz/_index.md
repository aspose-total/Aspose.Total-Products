Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export PDF to WMZ image within any .NET applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are two powerful components that can be used to export PDF to WMZ image.

Using Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can export PDF to JPEG image in two simple steps. First, they can load the PDF document into the Aspose.PDF for .NET API. Then, they can use the API to export the PDF document to JPEG image. This process is simple and straightforward, and it can be done in a few lines of code.

Once the PDF document has been exported to JPEG image, developers can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert the JPEG image to WMZ. This API provides a wide range of image processing features, such as image resizing, cropping, and rotation. It also supports a variety of image formats, including WMZ. With this API, developers can easily convert JPEG to WMZ in a few lines of code.

Overall, Aspose.Total for .NET makes it easy for developers to export PDF to WMZ image within any .NET applications. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can export PDF to JPEG image. Then, with Aspose.Imaging for .NET, they can convert the JPEG image to WMZ. This process is simple and straightforward, and it can be done in a few lines of code.

1. Open PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render PDF to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to WMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to WMZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PDF document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to WMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to WMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF to WMZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to WMZ with watermark in your WMZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your PDF document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as WMZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PDF File to WMZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output WMZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
