Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export PCL to WMF image within any .NET applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are two powerful components that can be used to achieve the desired result. 

The first step in the process is to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export PCL to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features that enable developers to manipulate PDF documents in various ways. It can be used to convert PCL to JPEG with just a few lines of code. 

Once the PCL has been converted to JPEG, the next step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert the JPEG to WMF. This component provides a comprehensive set of image processing features that enable developers to manipulate images in various ways. It can be used to convert JPEG to WMF with just a few lines of code. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for .NET is a great suite of components that can be used to easily export PCL to WMF image within any .NET applications. It provides developers with the tools they need to quickly and easily convert PCL to JPEG and then convert JPEG to WMF. With just a few lines of code, developers can achieve the desired result in no time.

1. Open PCL file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render PCL to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to WMF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PCL File to WMF in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PCL file to WMF to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PCL document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to WMF. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to WMF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PCL to WMF With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PCL file to WMF with watermark in your WMF document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your PCL document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as WMF format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PCL File to WMF via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output WMF image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
