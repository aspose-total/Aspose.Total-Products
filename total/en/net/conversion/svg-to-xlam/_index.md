<h2 class="heading-border">Is it possible to Convert SVG to XLAM via .NET?</h2>

Converting SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to XLAM (Excel Add-In) directly is not a standard or common conversion operation, and it's typically not supported by native Excel functionality. SVG is a vector graphics format used for web and graphics applications, while XLAM files are Excel add-ins containing macros and custom functions.

In order to add a watermark, you can create a new Workbook object and open the converted XLSX document, select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its AddTextEffect function. After that you can save your XLSX document as XLAM with Watermark.
