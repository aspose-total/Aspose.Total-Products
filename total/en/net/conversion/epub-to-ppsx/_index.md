Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to Render EPUB to PPSX in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the EPUB file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert from one file format to another. 

Once the EPUB file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPSX. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert from one file format to another. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily and quickly Render EPUB to PPSX in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, is used to convert the EPUB file format to PPTX. Then, the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, is used to convert the PPTX to PPSX. This package of File Format Automation APIs makes it easy to quickly and accurately convert from one file format to another.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from EPUB File via .NET" %}}
While converting EPUB to PPSX, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a EPUB file’s XMP metadata. To get a EPUB file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input EPUB file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPSX File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPSX file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPSX read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsx
presentation.Save("output.ppsx", SaveFormat.Ppsx);
