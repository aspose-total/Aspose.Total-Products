Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily render a PS file to PPT in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the PS file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert from one file format to another. 

Once the PS file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPT. This API provides a comprehensive set of features that allow you to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert from one file format to another. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can quickly and easily render a PS file to PPT in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, can be used to convert the PS file format to PPTX, and the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert the PPTX to PPT. This package of File Format Automation APIs provides a powerful and efficient way to render PS to PPT.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from PS File via .NET" %}}
While converting PS to PPT, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a PS file’s XMP metadata. To get a PS file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input PS file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPT File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPT file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPT read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppt
presentation.Save("output.ppt", SaveFormat.Ppt);
