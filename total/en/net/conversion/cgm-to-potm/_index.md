Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily convert CGM to POTM in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the CGM file format into PPTX. This API provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert between different file formats. 

Once the CGM file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to POTM. This API provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate presentation documents, including the ability to convert between different file formats. It also provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate the content of the presentation, such as adding text, images, shapes, and more. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can quickly and easily convert CGM to POTM in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, can be used to convert the CGM file format to PPTX, and the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert the PPTX to POTM. This package of File Format Automation APIs provides a range of features that allow you to manipulate documents and presentations, making it an ideal solution for quickly and easily converting CGM to POTM.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from CGM File via .NET" %}}
While converting CGM to POTM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a CGM file’s XMP metadata. To get a CGM file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input CGM file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only POTM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your POTM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make POTM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Potm
presentation.Save("output.potm", SaveFormat.Potm);
