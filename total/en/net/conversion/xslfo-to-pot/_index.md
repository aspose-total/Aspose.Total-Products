Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily render XSLFO to POT in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the XSLFO file format into PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and merging PDFs. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to POT. This API provides a comprehensive set of features that allow you to create, edit, and convert presentations, as well as manipulate slides, shapes, and text. It also supports a wide range of presentation formats, including PPT, PPTX, PPS, PPSX, POT, POTX, and ODP.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POT format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Pot` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from XSLFO File via .NET" %}}
While converting XSLFO to POT, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a XSLFO file’s XMP metadata. To get a XSLFO file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input XSLFO file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open XSLFO document
Document doc = new Document("input.xslfo");
// get XSLFO XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only POT File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your POT file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make POT read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pot
presentation.Save("output.pot", SaveFormat.Pot);
