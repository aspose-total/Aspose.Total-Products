Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to Render XML to PPSM in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the XML file format into PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features that allow you to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert XML to PPTX. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPSM. This API provides a comprehensive set of features that allow you to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert PPTX to PPSM. It also provides a range of features that allow you to add text, images, shapes, and other elements to your presentations. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily Render XML to PPSM in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, allows you to convert XML to PPTX, and the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, allows you to convert PPTX to PPSM. This package of File Format Automation APIs provides a comprehensive set of features that make it easy to manipulate and convert various file formats.

2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPSM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Ppsm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from XML File via .NET" %}}
While converting XML to PPSM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a XML file’s XMP metadata. To get a XML file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input XML file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml");
// get XML XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPSM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPSM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPSM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsm
presentation.Save("output.ppsm", SaveFormat.Ppsm);
