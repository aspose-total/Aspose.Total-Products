Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that enables developers to easily export PS to WMZ image within any .NET applications. This suite of APIs includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are both powerful and feature-rich APIs that can be used to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. 

Using Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can export PS to JPEG in a few simple steps. This API provides a wide range of features that allow developers to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents. It also provides a set of features that enable developers to export PS to JPEG. 

Once the PS file is converted to JPEG, Aspose.Imaging for .NET can be used to convert JPEG to WMZ. This API provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to manipulate and convert various image formats. It also provides a set of features that enable developers to convert JPEG to WMZ. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export PS to WMZ image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. First, they can use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export PS to JPEG. Then, they can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to WMZ. This suite of APIs provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It also provides a set of features that enable developers to export PS to WMZ image within any .NET applications.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render PS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to WMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS File to WMZ in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PS file to WMZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PS document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to WMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to WMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS to WMZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PS file to WMZ with watermark in your WMZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your PS document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as WMZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PS File to WMZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output WMZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
