{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Common Scenarios and Challenges" %}}
Extracting top thread cases for **XSL-FO to XLTX** conversions involves identifying common scenarios, challenges, and use cases where such conversions are required. Below are the **common scenarios and challenges** for converting XSL-FO to XLTX:

---

### **1. Complex Layout Preservation**
   - **Scenario**: XSL-FO is often used for highly structured and complex layouts (e.g., invoices, reports, or legal documents). Converting these layouts into Excel templates (XLTX) while preserving formatting (e.g., tables, headers, footers, and multi-column layouts) is a common challenge.
   - **Thread Case**:
     - How to maintain the structure of tables, nested tables, and multi-column layouts in Excel.
     - Handling page breaks, headers, and footers from XSL-FO in Excel templates.
     - Preserving styles (e.g., fonts, colors, borders) during conversion.

---

### **2. Dynamic Data Mapping**
   - **Scenario**: XSL-FO is typically used to format XML data. When converting to XLTX, the dynamic data (e.g., placeholders, variables, or repeating elements) must be mapped to Excel cells or ranges.
   - **Thread Case**:
     - How to map XML data nodes to specific Excel cells or ranges in the template.
     - Handling repeating elements (e.g., rows in a table) dynamically in Excel.
     - Managing conditional formatting or data-driven styling in Excel.

---

### **3. Handling Large Datasets**
   - **Scenario**: XSL-FO documents often contain large datasets (e.g., financial reports or inventory lists). Converting these to Excel templates while maintaining performance and avoiding file size issues is a common challenge.
   - **Thread Case**:
     - How to handle large datasets without exceeding Excel's row/column limits.
     - Optimizing performance during conversion to avoid timeouts or memory issues.
     - Splitting large XSL-FO documents into multiple Excel sheets or files.
