Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export PostScript (PS) to JPEG2000 image within any .NET applications. This suite of components provides a wide range of features and capabilities that can be used to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. 

The process of exporting PS to JPEG2000 image can be completed in two simple steps. First, by using Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can export PS to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features and capabilities that can be used to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. It also provides the ability to export PS to JPEG with high quality and accuracy. 

Once the PS file is converted to JPEG, the second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET Image Processing API to convert JPEG to JPEG2000. This API provides a wide range of features and capabilities that can be used to manipulate and convert various image formats. It also provides the ability to convert JPEG to JPEG2000 with high quality and accuracy.

1. Open PS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render PS to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with .NET File Automation APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total``` or install directly from Package Manager Console of Visual Studio.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/net).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS File to JPEG2000 in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PS file to JPEG2000 to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PS document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to JPEG2000. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to JPEG2000 format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PS to JPEG2000 With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PS file to JPEG2000 with watermark in your JPEG2000 document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your PS document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PS File to JPEG2000 via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output JPEG2000 image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
