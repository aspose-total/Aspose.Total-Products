{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-summary %}}
By using [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can parse JSON to SVGZ  within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application in two simple steps. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/), you can export JSON to JPEG. After that, by using [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net/), you can convert JPEG to SVGZ.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) object and read JSON data from file
2. Convert JSON to JPEG using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.workbook/save/methods/4) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to SVGZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Install from the command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/total/net).

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to SVGZ via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to SVGZ, you can also set layout options for your JSON using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse JSON Format to SVGZ with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to SVGZ with watermark in your SVGZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your JSON document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark to it, you can save the JPEG as SVGZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.
