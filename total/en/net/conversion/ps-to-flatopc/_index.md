Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive API that provides powerful document manipulation and conversion features for .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which enables developers to convert PostScript (PS) files to the DOC format. Once the conversion is complete, the Aspose.Words for .NET API can be used to render the DOC file to the FLATOPC format. 

The Aspose.PDF for .NET API is a powerful tool for converting PS files to DOC. It supports a wide range of features, including the ability to convert multiple PS files to DOC in a single operation. It also supports the conversion of encrypted PS files, as well as the conversion of PS files with embedded fonts. Additionally, the API can be used to convert PS files to other popular document formats, such as HTML, XPS, and PDF.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt PS File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting PS to FLATOPC, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the PS using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly FLATOPC- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your FLATOPC from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");

document.Save("output.flatopc", SaveFormat.FlatOpc);
