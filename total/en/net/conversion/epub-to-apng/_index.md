Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export EPUB to APNG image within any .NET applications. This suite of components provides a wide range of features and functionalities that can be used to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats. 

The process of exporting EPUB to APNG image involves two simple steps. First, by using Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can export EPUB to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features and functionalities that can be used to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents. It also provides support for various image formats, including JPEG. 

Once the EPUB has been converted to JPEG, the second step involves using Aspose.Imaging for .NET Image Processing API to convert the JPEG to APNG. This API provides a wide range of features and functionalities that can be used to manipulate and convert various image formats. It also provides support for various image formats, including APNG.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to APNG format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB File to APNG in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to APNG to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to APNG. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to APNG format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to APNG With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to APNG with watermark in your APNG document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your EPUB document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as APNG format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate EPUB File to APNG via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output APNG image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
