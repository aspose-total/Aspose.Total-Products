Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that can be used to easily render EPUB to PPTM in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the EPUB file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, such as creating, editing, converting, and merging PDF files. It also supports a variety of file formats, including EPUB, PPTX, and many more. 

Once the EPUB file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPTM. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, such as adding text, images, shapes, and charts. It also supports a variety of file formats, including PPTX, PPTM, and many more.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from EPUB File via .NET" %}}
While converting EPUB to PPTM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a EPUB file’s XMP metadata. To get a EPUB file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input EPUB file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPTM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPTM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPTM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pptm
presentation.Save("output.pptm", SaveFormat.Pptm);
