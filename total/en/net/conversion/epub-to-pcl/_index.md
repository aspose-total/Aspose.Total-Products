{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt EPUB File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting EPUB to PCL, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the EPUB using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

In order to protect your PCL from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pcl
document.Save("output.pcl", SaveFormat.Pcl);    
```

Ebooks (Electronic Publication Format) files are used to store digital content, making them ideal for creating interactive multimedia documents. However, when working with print-on-demand requirements, Printable Content Files (PCF) become essential for precise control over layout and formatting.

The conversion of Ebooks into PCF formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your print-on-demand capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **High-Quality Printing**: Convert Ebooks to create professional-grade printed materials, including brochures, flyers, and other marketing collateral.
*   **Custom Layouts**: Use PCF to design custom layouts for print materials, ensuring accurate alignment and precise formatting.
*   **Precision Page Layout**: Convert Ebooks to create page layouts with precision control over margins, gutters, and other elements, reducing errors and increasing efficiency.
*   **Material Optimization**: Use PCF to optimize printable materials for specific industries or applications, such as real estate, finance, or healthcare.
*   **Fast Turnaround Times**: Convert Ebooks into PCF files for rapid print-on-demand production, allowing for quick turnaround times and efficient supply chain management.
