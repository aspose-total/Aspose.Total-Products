Before converting EMLX to PS, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EMLX document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// instantiate MapiMessage to load an EMLX file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.emlx");
// check for SenderName 
if(outlookMessageFile.SenderName == "John"){
    //proceed with conversion process

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PS Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMLX to PS, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ps
document.Save("output.ps", SaveFormat.Ps);  
```
