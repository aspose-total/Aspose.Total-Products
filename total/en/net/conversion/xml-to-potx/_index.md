Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to render XML to POTX in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the XML file format to PPTX. Then, the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert the PPTX to POTX. 

The Aspose.Total for .NET package is a comprehensive suite of APIs that can be used to automate the process of creating, editing, and converting documents and other file formats. It includes APIs for working with PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other popular file formats. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, is a powerful tool for transforming XML files into PPTX. It can be used to create, edit, and convert PDF documents, as well as to extract text, images, and other data from PDFs. 

The Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, is a powerful tool for converting PPTX to POTX. It can be used to create, edit, and convert presentations, as well as to extract text, images, and other data from presentations. It also includes features for creating and editing charts, tables, and other objects in presentations. 

Using the powerful File Format Automation APIs in the Aspose.Total for .NET package, you can easily render XML to POTX in two simple steps. First, use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the XML file format to PPTX. Then, use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to POTX. This powerful package of APIs makes it easy to automate the process of creating, editing, and converting documents and other file formats.

2. Convert XML to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to POTX format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Potx` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from XML File via .NET" %}}
While converting XML to POTX, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a XML file’s XMP metadata. To get a XML file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input XML file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open XML document
Document doc = new Document("input.xml");
// get XML XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only POTX File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your POTX file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make POTX read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Potx
presentation.Save("output.potx", SaveFormat.Potx);
