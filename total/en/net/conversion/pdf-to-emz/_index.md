Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export PDF to EMZ image within any .NET applications. This suite includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are two powerful components that can be used to convert PDF to EMZ. 

The process of converting PDF to EMZ involves two steps. First, Aspose.PDF for .NET can be used to export PDF to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features that can be used to manipulate PDF documents. It allows developers to read, write, and manipulate PDF documents without any external dependencies. It also provides the ability to convert PDF to various image formats, including JPEG. 

Once the PDF is converted to JPEG, Aspose.Imaging for .NET can be used to convert JPEG to EMZ. This component provides a comprehensive set of features for image processing. It allows developers to read, write, and manipulate various image formats, including EMZ. It also provides the ability to convert JPEG to EMZ. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export PDF to EMZ image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. This suite provides a comprehensive set of features for manipulating PDF documents and image processing. It allows developers to read, write, and manipulate PDF documents and various image formats without any external dependencies.

1. Open PDF file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render PDF to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to EMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF File to EMZ in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to EMZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your PDF document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to EMZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to EMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert PDF to EMZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert PDF file to EMZ with watermark in your EMZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your PDF document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as EMZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate PDF File to EMZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output EMZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
