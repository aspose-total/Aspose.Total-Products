There are many reasons to convert an XLT file to a WORD file. The most common reason is for compatibility purposes. WORD files are much more widely accepted than XLT files, so if you need to share your file with someone, it's best to convert it to a WORD file first.<br />

Another reason to convert an XLT file to a WORD file is for editing purposes. XLT files are generally not meant to be edited, so if you need to make changes to your file, you'll need to convert it to a WORD file first.<br />
