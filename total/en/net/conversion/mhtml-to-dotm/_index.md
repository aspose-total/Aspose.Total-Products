Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides powerful document manipulation and conversion features for .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which enables developers to convert MHTML files to DOC format. This API is equipped with a wide range of features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF documents, as well as to extract text, images, and other content from PDFs.

The Aspose.Words for .NET API is another powerful component of Aspose.Total for .NET. It enables developers to render DOC files to DOTM format, as well as to create, edit, and convert documents in various formats, such as DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML, and ODT. This API also provides features for manipulating document elements, such as text, images, tables, and shapes. It also supports mail merge, document comparison, and document signing.

In addition to the two APIs mentioned above, Aspose.Total for .NET also includes other APIs for manipulating and converting various document formats, such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Visio. It also includes APIs for manipulating images, barcodes, and email messages. All of these APIs are designed to be easy to use and integrate into .NET applications. With Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can quickly and easily add powerful document manipulation and conversion features to their applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt MHTML File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting MHTML to DOTM, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the MHTML using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.mhtml", "password");
// decrypt MHTML
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly DOTM- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your DOTM from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Dotm
document.Save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.Dotm);
