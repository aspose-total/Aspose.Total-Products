Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily create, manipulate and convert various file formats within their .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET applications. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to convert POTM files to XLSX.

The process of converting POTM to XLSX is simple and straightforward. It can be done in two steps. Firstly, you need to use Aspose.Slides for .NET to export the POTM file to HTML. This is done by using the Presentation.Save method, which allows you to save the presentation in HTML format.

Once the POTM file has been converted to HTML, you can then use Aspose.Cells for .NET to convert the HTML file to XLSX. This is done by using the Workbook.LoadFromHtml method, which allows you to load the HTML file into a Workbook object. Once the HTML file has been loaded, you can then use the Workbook.Save method to save the Workbook object as an XLSX file.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected POTM to XLSX via C#" %}}
While converting POTM file to XLSX, if your input POTM document is password protected you cannot convert it to XLSX without decrypting the document. When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.
