Converting JSON to OTP within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) to parse JSON to PPTX. This API is part of the [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) package. The second step is to use [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) to convert PPTX to OTP. This API is also part of the Aspose.Total for .NET package. 

The Aspose.Cells for .NET API is a powerful tool for parsing JSON to PPTX. It provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write various file formats, manipulate worksheets, and convert between different file formats. It also supports a variety of features for working with charts, images, and shapes. 

The Aspose.Slides for .NET API is a powerful tool for converting PPTX to OTP. It provides a wide range of features, such as the ability to read and write various file formats, manipulate slides, and convert between different file formats. It also supports a variety of features for working with charts, images, and shapes. 

By using the Aspose.Cells for .NET and Aspose.Slides for .NET APIs, you can easily convert JSON to OTP within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. Both APIs are part of the Aspose.Total for .NET package, which provides a comprehensive set of APIs for working with various file formats.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to OTP via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to OTP, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to OTP with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to OTP with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your OTP document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class, select the master presentation, add shape type using AddAutoShape, and add watermark text using AddTextFrame. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to OTP.
