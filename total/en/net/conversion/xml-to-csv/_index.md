<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert XML files to CSV via .NET?</h2>

Converting XML to CSV offers several benefits. Firstly, CSV files have a smaller file size compared to XML, which simplifies handling and processing. Furthermore, CSV files are compatible with a wide range of software applications such as databases, spreadsheets, and other data analysis tools, making it easier to work with data. Another advantage of converting XML to CSV is that CSV files are more user-friendly. XML files can be challenging to read and interpret, particularly if they have nested structures. In contrast, CSV files are more straightforward and easier to comprehend, even for individuals without technical expertise. This makes them a preferred format for data sharing and analysis.
