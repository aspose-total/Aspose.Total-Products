Before converting MSG to JPEG, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load MSG document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict JPEG Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from MSG to JPEG, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Jpeg
document.Save("output.jpeg", SaveFormat.Jpeg);  
```

MSG (Message) files are used to store plain text information, making them ideal for creating simple messages and communications. However, when working with images and multimedia content, JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) becomes an essential format.

The conversion of MSG files into JPEG formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your visual content sharing and display capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Image Sharing**: Convert MSG files to share images, such as photos and graphics, with others via email or messaging platforms.
*   **Social Media Posting**: Use JPEG to post high-quality images on social media platforms, enhancing your online presence.
*   **Website Graphics**: Convert MSG files to create visually appealing website graphics, including logos, icons, and other multimedia elements.
*   **Graphic Design Projects**: Use JPEG to store and share graphic design files, such as posters, flyers, and brochures.
*   **Digital Storytelling**: Convert MSG files to create interactive digital stories, including animations and video content.
