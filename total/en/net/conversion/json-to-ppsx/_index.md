Converting JSON to PPSX within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application is a simple two-step process. The first step is to use the Aspose.Cells for .NET API to parse the JSON into a PPTX file. This API is part of the Aspose.Total for .NET package. The second step is to use the Aspose.Slides for .NET API to convert the PPTX file to a PPSX file. This API is also part of the Aspose.Total for .NET package. 

The Aspose.Cells for .NET API is a powerful library that can be used to create, read, edit and convert spreadsheets. It supports a wide range of file formats, including JSON. It also provides features such as data validation, conditional formatting, charting, and more. 

The Aspose.Slides for .NET API is a powerful library that can be used to create, read, edit and convert presentations. It supports a wide range of file formats, including PPTX and PPSX. It also provides features such as text formatting, animation, transitions, and more. 

By using the Aspose.Total for .NET package, developers can easily convert JSON to PPSX within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. This package provides a comprehensive set of APIs that can be used to create, read, edit and convert a wide range of file formats.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to PPSX via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to PPSX, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PPSX with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPSX with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPSX document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class, select the master presentation, add shape type using AddAutoShape, and add watermark text using AddTextFrame. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to PPSX.
