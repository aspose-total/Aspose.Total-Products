 In order to automate the process for any PowerPoint pptm presentation to Word ott files batch conversion, weâ€™ll use [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net) and [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) APIs. The former is a PowerPoint presentation manipulation API that lets you create or modify Microsoft PowerPoint slides. Whereas, the latter is a word processing API for processing or manipulating Microsoft Word documents. Both APIs are part of [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net) package. You can directly [download](https://releases.aspose.com/) from Nuget or may use the following commands from the Package Manager Console.

                          <span itemprop="text">this online converter is fast, but the speed of the PPTM to OTT conversion mainly depends on the size of the PPTM file being converted. Smaller PPTM files can be rendered into OTT format within seconds. Additionally, if you have integrated the PPTM to OTT conversion code within a .NET application, the conversion speed will depend on how well you have optimized your application for the conversion process.</span>
