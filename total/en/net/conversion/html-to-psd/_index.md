<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert HTML to PSD format?</h2>

Converting HTML to PSD (Photoshop Document) format using C# can be beneficial for various purposes. By utilizing the Aspose.Total for .NET API, you can automate this conversion process seamlessly within your C# application. Converting HTML to PSD allows you to preserve the visual layout, styles, and elements of the HTML document in a format that can be further edited and manipulated using professional graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop. This can be particularly useful when you want to transform HTML-based designs or web content into high-quality graphics or incorporate HTML elements into complex graphic compositions.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to PSD in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert HTML file to PSD to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your HTML document to one TIFF file and after that, you can export TIFF file to PSD. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load the TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to PSD format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert HTML to PSD With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert HTML file to PSD with a watermark in your PSD document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your HTML document to JPEG and add a watermark to it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of the Matrix class, and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark to it, you can save the JPEG as PSD format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate HTML File to PSD via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output PSD image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image, you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
