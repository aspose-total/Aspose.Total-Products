Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to Render EPUB to OTP in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the EPUB file format into PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert EPUB to PPTX. 

The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to OTP. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert PPTX to OTP. It also provides a range of features to enhance presentations, such as adding text, images, shapes, and animations. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can quickly and easily Render EPUB to OTP in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, can be used to convert EPUB to PPTX, and the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert PPTX to OTP. Both APIs provide a wide range of features to manipulate documents and presentations, making it easy to create professional-looking documents and presentations.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from EPUB File via .NET" %}}
While converting EPUB to OTP, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a EPUB file’s XMP metadata. To get a EPUB file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input EPUB file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open EPUB document
Document doc = new Document("input.epub");
// get EPUB XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only OTP File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your OTP file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make OTP read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Otp
presentation.Save("output.otp", SaveFormat.Otp);
