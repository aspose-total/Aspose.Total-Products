{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt PS File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting PS to PCL, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the PS using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.ps", "password");
// decrypt PS
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly PCL- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your PCL from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pcl
document.Save("output.pcl", SaveFormat.Pcl);
