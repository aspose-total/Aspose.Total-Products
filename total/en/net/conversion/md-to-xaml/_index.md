{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from MD File via .NET" %}}
While converting MD to XAML, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a MD file’s XMP metadata. To get a MD file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input MD file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only XAML File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your XAML file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make XAML read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xaml
presentation.Save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

**Converting Markdown Files to XAML: Unlocking the Full Potential of Your UI**

Markdown (MD) files have become an essential tool for content creators, developers, and designers alike. However, when it comes to building user interfaces (UI), XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) is the preferred format.

Converting MD files to XAML enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **User Interface Design**: Convert MD files to create visually appealing and interactive UI components, such as buttons, labels, and text boxes.
*   **Mobile App Development**: Use XAML to design and build mobile apps that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations.
*   **Desktop Application Development**: Convert MD files to create desktop applications with custom UI elements, layouts, and animations.
*   **Web Application Development**: Use XAML to build web applications with rich UI components, such as data grids, charts, and maps.
*   **Accessibility Optimization**: Convert MD files to ensure your UI is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

By converting Markdown files to XAML, you can unlock the full potential of your UI design capabilities and create stunning, interactive experiences for your users.
