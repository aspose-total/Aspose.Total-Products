{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt EPUB File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting EPUB to DOTM, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the EPUB using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly DOTM- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your DOTM from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Dotm
document.Save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.Dotm);    
```

Epub (Electronic Publication) files are used to store digital publications, making them ideal for creating accessible and portable content. However, when working with dynamic data, Microsoft Office formats like DOTM become essential for advanced data analysis and modification capabilities.

The conversion of Epub files into DOTM formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your data analysis and modification capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Advanced Data Analysis**: Convert Epub files to analyze digital publication content, track reader engagement, and identify trends in audience behavior.
*   **Dynamic Content Updates**: Use DOTM to create interactive content updates, modify layouts, and apply conditional formatting for enhanced readability.
*   **Collaborative Editing**: Convert Epub files to facilitate collaborative editing, commenting, and tracking of changes across multiple users.
*   **Accessibility Enhancements**: Use DOTM to add accessibility features, such as text-to-speech functionality, font size adjustments, and high contrast modes.
*   **Data Visualization**: Convert Epub files to create interactive data visualizations, enable filtering, sorting, and grouping of content for better insights.
