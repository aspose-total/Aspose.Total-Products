Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to Render SVG to SWF in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the SVG file format into PPTX. The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to SWF. 

The Aspose.Total for .NET package provides a comprehensive set of APIs that enable developers to automate the process of creating, editing, and converting a variety of file formats. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, is a powerful tool that enables developers to manipulate PDF documents with ease. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, and converting PDF documents. The Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, is a powerful tool that enables developers to create, edit, and convert presentations. It provides a wide range of features such as creating, editing, and converting presentations. 

Using the Aspose.Total for .NET package, developers can easily Render SVG to SWF in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the SVG file format into PPTX. The second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to SWF. This process is simple and efficient, and it allows developers to quickly and easily convert SVG files to SWF.

1. Open SVG file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert SVG to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to SWF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Swf` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from SVG File via .NET" %}}
While converting SVG to SWF, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a SVG file’s XMP metadata. To get a SVG file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input SVG file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open SVG document
Document doc = new Document("input.svg");
// get SVG XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only SWF File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your SWF file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make SWF read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Swf
presentation.Save("output.swf", SaveFormat.Swf);
