{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-summary %}}
You can convert JSON to PPTM within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application in two simple steps. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/), you can parse JSON to PPTX. After that, by using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/), you can convert PPTX to PPTM. Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) package.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonutility) class and [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.workbook/save/methods/4) it as PPTX 
3. Load PPTX document by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to PPTM via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to PPTM, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert JSON Format to PPTM with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to PPTM with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your PPTM document, you can first parse JSON to PPTX and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PPTX file using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class, select the master presentation, add shape type using AddAutoShape, and add watermark text using AddTextFrame. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to PPTM.
