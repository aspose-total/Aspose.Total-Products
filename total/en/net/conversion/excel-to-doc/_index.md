There are many reasons to convert an Excel file to a DOC file. One reason is that a DOC file is much easier to read and edit than an Excel file. A DOC file can be opened in any word processor, such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Writer.<br />

Another reason to convert an Excel file to a DOC file is that a DOC file is much smaller in size than an Excel file. This is because a DOC file only contains text, while an Excel file contains both text and data.<br />

Aspose.Total for .NET API is a powerful tool that can help you convert an Excel file to a DOC file. Aspose.Total for .NET API can convert an Excel file to a DOC file in just a few seconds.
