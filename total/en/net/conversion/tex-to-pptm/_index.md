Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to render TEX to PPTM in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the TEX file format to PPTX. This API provides a wide range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert between different file formats. 

Once the TEX file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPTM. This API provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, and manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert between different file formats. It also provides a range of features to enhance presentations, such as adding text, images, shapes, and animations. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily and quickly render TEX to PPTM in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, can be used to convert the TEX file format to PPTX. Then, the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, can be used to convert the PPTX to PPTM. With these powerful APIs, you can quickly and easily transform TEX files into PPTM files.

1. Open TEX file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert TEX to PPTX by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to PPTM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Pptm` as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from TEX File via .NET" %}}
While converting TEX to PPTM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a TEX file’s XMP metadata. To get a TEX file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input TEX file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open TEX document
Document doc = new Document("input.tex");
// get TEX XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPTM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPTM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPTM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pptm
presentation.Save("output.pptm", SaveFormat.Pptm);
