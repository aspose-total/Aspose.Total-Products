If your MD document is password protected, you cannot convert it to ODS without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it.  In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and pass the filename and password as arguments.

While converting MD file to ODS, you can also add watermark to your output ODS file format. In order to add a watermark, you can create a new Workbook object and open the converted XLSX document, select Worksheet via its index, create a Shape and use its AddTextEffect function. After that you can save your XLSX document as ODS with Watermark.
