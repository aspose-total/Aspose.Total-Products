<h2 class="heading-border">Why Convert EML to PDF format?</h2>
In the realm of .NET development, there's a compelling need to integrate EML to PDF conversion capabilities into your applications. EML files, while efficient for email storage, often fall short in terms of shareability and presentation. The conversion to PDF resolves this limitation, ensuring seamless cross-platform compatibility and safeguarding the layout and formatting of emails. Furthermore, the shift to PDF adds an essential layer of document security, guaranteeing the confidentiality of sensitive email content. Simplifying the sharing process, PDF's universal acceptance makes it an optimal choice for making emails more accessible across different devices and email clients.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EML File via .NET" %}}
Before converting EML to PDF, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EML document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// instantiate MapiMessage to load an EML file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.eml");
// check for SenderName 
if(outlookMessageFile.SenderName == "John"){
    //proceed with conversion process
}
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PDF Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to PDF, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pdf
document.Save("output.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);  
```
