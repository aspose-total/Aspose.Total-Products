{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected POTM to XLTX via C#" %}}
While converting POTM file to XLTX, if your input POTM document is password protected you cannot convert it to XLTX without decrypting the document. When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.
