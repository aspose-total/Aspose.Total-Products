{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt MD File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting MD to DOT, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the MD using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly DOT- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your DOT from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Dot
document.Save("output.dot", SaveFormat.Dot);    
```

**Conversion Case:** MD (Markdown) files are used to store text-based information, making them ideal for creating simple documentation and content. However, when working with complex formatting and layout requirements, DOT (Diagram Interchange File Format) files become essential for visual representation.

The conversion of MD files into DOT formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your visual representation capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Technical Documentation**: Convert MD files to create interactive diagrams and flowcharts for technical documentation, enabling easier understanding and navigation.
*   **Business Process Modeling**: Use DOT to visualize complex business processes, creating interactive and dynamic models for analysis and optimization.
*   **Software Development and Architecture**: Convert MD files to create detailed software architecture diagrams, UML class diagrams, and system architecture models, facilitating better project planning and execution.
*   **Education and Training Materials**: Use DOT to create interactive tutorials, guides, and instructional materials, making complex information more accessible and engaging for learners.
*   **Research and Academic Presentations**: Convert MD files to create visually appealing and well-structured academic presentations, posters, and research papers, showcasing research findings and data in a clear and concise manner.

By converting MD files into DOT formats, you can unlock the full potential of your visual representation capabilities, creating interactive and dynamic diagrams that enhance communication, collaboration, and decision-making.
