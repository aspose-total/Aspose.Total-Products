 In order to automate the process for any PowerPoint pptm presentation to Word flatopc files batch conversion, weâ€™ll use [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net) and [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) APIs. The former is a PowerPoint presentation manipulation API that lets you create or modify Microsoft PowerPoint slides. Whereas, the latter is a word processing API for processing or manipulating Microsoft Word documents. Both APIs are part of [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net) package. You can directly [download](https://releases.aspose.com/) from Nuget or may use the following commands from the Package Manager Console.
