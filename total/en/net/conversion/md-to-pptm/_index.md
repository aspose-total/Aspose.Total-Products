Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful package of File Format Automation APIs that makes it easy to render MD to PPTM in two simple steps. The first step is to use the PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, to transform the MD file format to PPTX. This API provides a range of features to manipulate PDF documents, including the ability to convert from one file format to another. 

Once the MD file has been converted to PPTX, the second step is to use the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, to convert the PPTX to PPTM. This API provides a range of features to manipulate presentations, including the ability to convert from one file format to another. It also provides the ability to create, edit, and save presentations in a variety of formats, including PPTM. 

Using Aspose.Total for .NET, you can easily render MD to PPTM in two simple steps. The PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, is used to convert the MD file format to PPTX. Then, the Presentation Processing API, Aspose.Slides for .NET, is used to convert the PPTX to PPTM. This package of File Format Automation APIs makes it easy to manipulate and convert documents and presentations from one file format to another.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from MD File via .NET" %}}
While converting MD to PPTM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a MD file’s XMP metadata. To get a MD file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input MD file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPTM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPTM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPTM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pptm
presentation.Save("output.pptm", SaveFormat.Pptm);     
```
