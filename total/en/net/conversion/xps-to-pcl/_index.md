Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive API that provides developers with the ability to add document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications. It includes a powerful PDF Processing API, Aspose.PDF for .NET, which allows developers to convert XPS file formats to DOC. Once the conversion is complete, the powerful Document Processing API, Aspose.Words for .NET, can be used to render the DOC file to PCL. 

The PDF Processing API provides developers with a wide range of features, such as the ability to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also allows developers to extract text, images, and other content from PDF files. The API also supports the conversion of PDF documents to other popular file formats, such as HTML, XPS, and TIFF. 

The Document Processing API provides developers with a range of features for manipulating and converting documents. It supports the conversion of DOC files to other popular file formats, such as HTML, PDF, and XPS. It also allows developers to create, edit, and convert documents, as well as extract text, images, and other content from documents.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert XPS to Doc by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load Doc file by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class of Aspose.Words 
4. Save the document to PCL format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.document/save/methods/4) method and set Pcl as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt XPS File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting XPS to PCL, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the XPS using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.xps", "password");
// decrypt XPS
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly PCL- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your PCL from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pcl
document.Save("output.pcl", SaveFormat.Pcl);
