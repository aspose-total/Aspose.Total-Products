If you have been using Microsoft Excel for a while, you may have come across .xlt files. These are template files that can be used to create new Excel workbooks. While .xlt files are useful, they have some limitations. For example, they cannot be opened in PowerPoint. This is where Aspose.Total for .NET API comes in.<br />

Aspose.Total for .NET API is a powerful tool that can be used to convert .xlt files to .pptx files. This is useful if you want to open your Excel template in PowerPoint or if you want to share your template with others who do not have Excel installed. Aspose.Total for .NET API preserves the formatting of the original .xlt file so you do not need to worry about losing any data during the conversion process.
