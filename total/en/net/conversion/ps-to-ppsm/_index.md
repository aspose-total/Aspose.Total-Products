{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from PS File via .NET" %}}
While converting PS to PPSM, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a PS file’s XMP metadata. To get a PS file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input PS file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only PPSM File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your PPSM file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.

```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make PPSM read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Ppsm
presentation.Save("output.ppsm", SaveFormat.Ppsm);     
```

**File Conversion Guide**

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are used to store documents, making them ideal for printing and sharing. However, when working with editable content, Microsoft Office formats become essential for editing and collaboration.

The conversion of PDF files into PPSM (PowerPoint Slide Master) formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your presentation design and layout capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Corporate Presentation Design**: Convert PDF files to create consistent corporate branding, logos, and typography across all presentations.
*   **Marketing Material Creation**: Use PPSM to design and edit marketing materials, such as brochures, flyers, and posters.
*   **Training Materials Development**: Convert PDF files to create interactive training materials, simulations, and tutorials.
*   **Publication Design and Layout**: Use PPSM to design and edit publication layouts, including magazines, newspapers, and journals.
*   **Custom PowerPoint Templates**: Convert PDF files to create custom PowerPoint templates, saving time and effort for designers and presenters.
