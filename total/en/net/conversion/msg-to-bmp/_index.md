Before converting MSG to BMP, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load MSG document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict BMP Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from MSG to BMP, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Bmp
document.Save("output.bmp", SaveFormat.Bmp);  
```

MSG (Message File) files are used to store text-based messages, making them ideal for creating simple communication protocols and data exchange between applications. However, when working with image-based data, bitmap files like BMP become essential for image storage and sharing.

The conversion of MSG files into BMP formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your image viewing and editing capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Image Viewing and Editing**: Convert MSG files to view and edit images, including bitmap files with high-resolution graphics and detailed textures.
*   **Game Development and Deployment**: Use BMP files to store game assets, such as sprites, backgrounds, and effects, making it easier to deploy games across different platforms.
*   **Logo Design and Branding**: Convert MSG files to create vector-based logos, allowing for scalable and high-quality branding materials.
*   **Digital Signage and Display**: Use BMP files to display images on digital signage, including menus, advertisements, and information displays.
*   **Medical Imaging and Diagnostics**: Convert MSG files to visualize medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, facilitating accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.
