{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Transforming MD File to DICOM Programmatically : Use Cases" %}}
**Case:** MD (Medical Document) files are used to store medical imaging data, making them ideal for creating detailed records of patient information. However, when working with radiology departments and medical facilities, DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files become essential for efficient image sharing and storage.

The conversion of MD files into DICOM formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your medical imaging capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Medical Image Sharing**: Convert MD files to share medical images between hospitals, clinics, and radiologists, ensuring accurate diagnosis and treatment.
*   **Radiology Department Management**: Use DICOM to manage patient records, track image orders, and optimize workflow.
*   **Image Storage and Retrieval**: Convert MD files to store medical images securely, making them accessible for future reference or analysis.
*   **Clinical Decision Support Systems**: Use DICOM to integrate medical images with clinical decision support systems, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.
*   **Regulatory Compliance**: Convert MD files to meet regulatory requirements, such as HIPAA, by storing and sharing medical images in a secure and compliant manner.
