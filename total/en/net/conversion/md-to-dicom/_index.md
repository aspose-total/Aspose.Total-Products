Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export MD to DICOM image within any .NET applications. This powerful suite of components provides a wide range of features and capabilities that make it easy to create, edit, and convert various file formats. 

The process of exporting MD to DICOM image can be completed in two simple steps. First, Aspose.PDF for .NET can be used to export MD to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features and capabilities that make it easy to create, edit, and convert PDF documents. It also supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, which makes it ideal for exporting MD to JPEG. 

Once the MD has been exported to JPEG, Aspose.Imaging for .NET can be used to convert the JPEG to DICOM. This powerful Image Processing API provides a wide range of features and capabilities that make it easy to manipulate and convert various image formats. It also supports a variety of medical image formats, including DICOM, which makes it ideal for converting JPEG to DICOM. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export MD to DICOM image within any .NET applications. This comprehensive suite of components provides a wide range of features and capabilities that make it easy to create, edit, and convert various file formats. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can export MD to JPEG, and with Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can convert JPEG to DICOM. This makes it easy to export MD to DICOM image within any .NET applications.

1. Open MD file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render MD to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to DICOM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert MD File to DICOM in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert MD file to DICOM to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your MD document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to DICOM. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to DICOM format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert MD to DICOM With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert MD file to DICOM with watermark in your DICOM document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your MD document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as DICOM format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate MD File to DICOM via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output DICOM image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
