{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict XPS Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMAIL to XPS, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xps
document.Save("output.xps", SaveFormat.Xps);  
```

Converting Emails to XPS Files: Unlocking the Potential of Visual Content.

Emails are an essential tool for communication, but when it comes to visual content, they often fall short. Unlike other formats like PDF or XPS, which preserve the original graphics and layout, emails can compromise on image quality and formatting during transmission.

That's where conversion comes in. Converting emails to XPS files is a straightforward process that enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Visual Content Preservation**: Convert emails to XPS files to ensure your visual content remains intact, even when shared or archived.
*   **Print-Friendly Communications**: Use XPS files to create print-friendly versions of your emails, perfect for presentations, reports, and other formal communications.
*   **Security and Compliance**: Convert emails to XPS files to meet regulatory requirements and ensure the security of sensitive visual content.
*   **Archiving and Retention**: Store XPS files to preserve email attachments and images for future reference or compliance purposes.
*   **Accessibility and Inclusion**: Convert emails to XPS files to improve accessibility by providing an alternative format for visually impaired users.

By converting your emails to XPS files, you can unlock the full potential of your visual content and ensure it remains vibrant and intact.
