If you are a .NET developer looking to add EMLX to PCL conversion features inside your applications, [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) file format manipulation APIs are the way forward. By using [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/), you can convert EMLX file format to HTML. After that, by using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/), you can render HTML to PCL.

1. Open EMLX file using [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage) class
2. Convert EMLX to HTML by using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mailmessage/save/methods/3) method
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class 
4. Save the document to PCL format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.document/save/methods/4) method and set Pcl as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse EMLX File via .NET" %}}
Before converting EMLX to PCL, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EMLX document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// instantiate MapiMessage to load an EMLX file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.emlx");
// check for SenderName 
if(outlookMessageFile.SenderName == "John"){
    //proceed with conversion process
}
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict PCL Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EMLX to PCL, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Pcl
document.Save("output.pcl", SaveFormat.Pcl);  
```
