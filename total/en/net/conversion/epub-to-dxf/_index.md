Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily export EPUB to DXF image within any .NET applications. This suite of components includes Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, which are both essential for the conversion process. 

The first step of the process is to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export EPUB to JPEG. This component provides a wide range of features that allow developers to manipulate PDF documents in a variety of ways. It can be used to convert EPUB to JPEG with just a few lines of code. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to DXF. This component provides a comprehensive set of image processing features that enable developers to manipulate images in a variety of ways. It can be used to convert JPEG to DXF with just a few lines of code. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for .NET makes it easy to export EPUB to DXF image within any .NET applications. By using Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can quickly and easily convert EPUB to JPEG and then JPEG to DXF with just a few lines of code. This makes it easy to create high-quality DXF images from EPUB documents in a matter of minutes.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to DXF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to DXF to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to DXF. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to DXF format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to DXF With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB file to DXF with watermark in your DXF document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your EPUB document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as DXF format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate EPUB File to DXF via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output DXF image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
