By using [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can convert DOTM to JSON format within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application in two simple steps.

Using the API, you can also open the password-protected document. If your input DOTM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to JSON format without using the password. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object. The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert DOTM to JSON in Range via C#" %}}
While you are converting DOTM to JSON, you can also set range to your output JSON format. In order to set the range, you can open the converted HTML using Workbook class, get CellsCollection of the Worksheet containing the data, create a range from CellsCollection by specifying row & column indices, and call ExportRangeToJson method with references to Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions objects. Finally, you can save the JSON data to file via File.WriteAllText method.
