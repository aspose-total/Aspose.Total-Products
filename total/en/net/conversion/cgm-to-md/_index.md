With Aspose.Total for .NET, converting CGM files to MD (Markdown) format within .NET, C#, ASP.NET, and VB.NET applications becomes effortless. The conversion process involves two simple steps, leveraging the capabilities of Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Cells for .NET Spreadsheet Programming API.

To begin, using Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can export CGM files to XLSX (Excel) format. Aspose.PDF for .NET provides a powerful API for working with PDF documents and offers comprehensive functionality for seamless CGM to XLSX conversion.

Once you have the XLSX file, the next step involves utilizing Aspose.Cells for .NET. This Spreadsheet Programming API allows you to easily convert XLSX to MD (Markdown) format.

If your CGM document is password protected, you cannot convert it to MD without the password. Using the API, you can first open the protected document using a valid password and convert it after it.  In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize a new instance of the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and pass the filename and password as arguments.
