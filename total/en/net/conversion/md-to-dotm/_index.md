Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive API that provides powerful document manipulation and conversion features for .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which enables developers to convert MD file format to DOC. This API is equipped with advanced PDF processing capabilities, allowing developers to easily manipulate PDF documents. 

Once the MD file is converted to DOC, the Aspose.Words for .NET API can be used to render the DOC to DOTM. This API provides powerful document processing capabilities, allowing developers to easily create, edit, and convert documents. It supports a wide range of document formats, including DOC, DOCX, DOTM, and more. It also provides features such as document merging, document splitting, document comparison, and more. 

In addition to the PDF and Word processing APIs, Aspose.Total for .NET also includes APIs for Excel, PowerPoint, Email, Barcode, and OCR. These APIs provide powerful features for manipulating and converting Excel, PowerPoint, Email, Barcode, and OCR documents. With these APIs, developers can easily create, edit, and convert documents in a variety of formats.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt MD File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting MD to DOTM, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the MD using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly DOTM- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your DOTM from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Dotm
document.Save("output.dotm", SaveFormat.Dotm);
