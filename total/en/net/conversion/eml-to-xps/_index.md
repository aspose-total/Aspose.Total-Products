Before converting EML to XPS, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load EML document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict XPS Document Editing via .NET" %}}
While saving the document from EML to XPS, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xps
document.Save("output.xps", SaveFormat.Xps);  
```

EML (Electronic Mail) files are used to store text-based emails, making them ideal for creating static documents and messages. However, when working with dynamic multimedia data, XPS (XML Paper Specification) files become essential for preserving the formatting and layout of content.

The conversion of EML files into XPS formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your document preservation and presentation capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Document Preservation**: Convert EML files to preserve historical emails, documents, and messages in a format that maintains their original layout and formatting.
*   **E-book Publishing**: Use XPS to create interactive e-books, preserving the formatting and typography of text content for optimal reading experiences.
*   **Digital Signature Validation**: Convert EML files to validate digital signatures and ensure authenticity of emails and documents.
*   **Accessibility Compliance**: Use XPS to create accessible documents that comply with WCAG standards, ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies.
*   **Forensic Analysis**: Convert EML files to analyze email content for forensic purposes, such as tracing sender locations or identifying malware.
