{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert Protected PPSM to MHTML via C#" %}}
While converting PPSM file to MHTML, if your input PPSM document is password protected you cannot convert it to MHTML without decrypting the document. When your document is password protected, it means it enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove the restrictions, the password has to be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation. The API allows you to open the encrypted document by passing the correct password in a LoadOptions object.
