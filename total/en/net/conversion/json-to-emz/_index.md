Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of components that enables developers to parse JSON to EMZ within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. This suite of components provides a simple two-step process to convert JSON to EMZ. 

The first step is to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to export JSON to JPEG. This component is a powerful spreadsheet processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert and render spreadsheets. It supports a wide range of file formats, including JSON, and provides a range of features to manipulate spreadsheets. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, developers can easily export JSON to JPEG. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to EMZ. This component is a powerful image processing API that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert and render images. It supports a wide range of file formats, including EMZ, and provides a range of features to manipulate images. With Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can easily convert JPEG to EMZ. 

By using Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily parse JSON to EMZ within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application. This suite of components provides a simple two-step process to convert JSON to EMZ. Firstly, developers can use Aspose.Cells for .NET to export JSON to JPEG. After that, they can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to EMZ. This process is quick and easy, and enables developers to quickly and easily parse JSON to EMZ.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) object and read JSON data from file
2. Convert JSON to JPEG using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.workbook/save/methods/4) method
3. Load JPEG document by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to EMZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Convert JSON Format to EMZ via C#" %}}
While parsing JSON to EMZ, you can also set layout options for your JSON using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse JSON Format to EMZ with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert JSON to EMZ with watermark in your EMZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your JSON document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark to it, you can save the JPEG as EMZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.
