{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt EPUB File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting EPUB to DOCM, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the EPUB using the owner’s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly DOCM- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your DOCM from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Docm
document.Save("output.docm", SaveFormat.Docm);    
```

Epub (Electronic Publication) files are widely used for storing digital books, articles, and other written content. However, when working with business-critical data, Word documents like .docx become essential for document management and collaboration.

The conversion of Epub files into .docx formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your document management and collaboration capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Project Management**: Convert Epub files to create project documentation, track progress, and share information with team members.
*   **Business Proposal Development**: Use .docx to visualize business proposal data, optimize strategies, and measure ROI.
*   **Whitepaper Creation**: Convert Epub files to create interactive whitepapers, simulate reader experiences, and validate content concepts.
*   **Sales Enablement Content**: Use .docx to visualize sales enablement content, optimize messaging, and measure engagement.
*   **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**: Convert Epub files to create shared documentation, reports, and visualizations for teams, enabling better decision-making.
