{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-summary %}}
Using a package of powerful File Format Automation APIs [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can easily Render XSLFO to XAML in two simple steps. By using PDF Processing API [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/), you can transform XSLFO file format to PPTX. After that, by using Presentation Processing API [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/), you can convert PPTX to XAML.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert XSLFO to PPTX by using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load PPTX file by using [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class 
4. Save the document to XAML format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.presentation/save/methods/5) method and set `Xaml` as SaveFormat

```cs// load XSLFO file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("input.xslfo");
// save XSLFO as a PPTX 
document.Save("PptxOutput.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx); 
// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xaml
presentation.Save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Get XMP Metadata from XSLFO File via .NET" %}}
While converting XSLFO to XAML, you might need extra XMP metadata information to prioritize your batch conversion process. For example you can get and sort your conversion documents based on creation date and process the documents accordingly. [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) allows you to access a XSLFO file’s XMP metadata. To get a XSLFO file’s metadata, you can create a [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the input XSLFO file. After that, you can get the file’s metadata using the [Metadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/properties/metadata) property.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open XSLFO document
Document doc = new Document("input.xslfo");
// get XSLFO XMP properties
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CreateDate"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:Nickname"]);
Console.WriteLine(doc.Metadata["xmp:CustomProperty"]);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create Read Only XAML File via .NET" %}}
 By using [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) API, you can further enhance the features of your conversion application. One of the feature can be to create your output file read only to increase security. The API allows you to set your XAML file to Read-Only, which means users (after they open the presentation) see the Read-Only recommendation.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load PPTX with an instance of Presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PptxOutput.pptx");
// make XAML read only
presentation.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Xaml
presentation.Save("output.xaml", SaveFormat.Xaml);
