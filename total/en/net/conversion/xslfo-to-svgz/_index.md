Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of .NET components that enables developers to easily create, manipulate, and convert various file formats within their .NET applications. It includes components for working with PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and other file formats. With Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export XSLFO to SVGZ image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. 

The first step is to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export XSLFO to JPEG. Aspose.PDF for .NET is a powerful PDF manipulation API that enables developers to create, read, edit, and convert PDF documents within their .NET applications. It provides a wide range of features for working with PDF documents, including the ability to export XSLFO to JPEG. 

The second step is to use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to SVGZ. Aspose.Imaging for .NET is an advanced image processing API that enables developers to create, edit, and convert various image formats within their .NET applications. It provides a wide range of features for working with images, including the ability to convert JPEG to SVGZ. 

With Aspose.Total for .NET, developers can easily export XSLFO to SVGZ image within any .NET applications in two simple steps. First, they can use Aspose.PDF for .NET to export XSLFO to JPEG. Then, they can use Aspose.Imaging for .NET to convert JPEG to SVGZ. This makes it easy for developers to create, manipulate, and convert various file formats within their .NET applications.

1. Open XSLFO file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render XSLFO to JPEG by using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to SVGZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert XSLFO File to SVGZ in a Single File via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert XSLFO file to SVGZ to a single image file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your XSLFO document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to SVGZ. You can open the input file using [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to SVGZ format using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert XSLFO to SVGZ With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert XSLFO file to SVGZ with watermark in your SVGZ document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your XSLFO document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as SVGZ format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert & Rotate XSLFO File to SVGZ via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also rotate the output SVGZ image as per your needs. The Image.RotateFlip method can be used to rotate the image by 90/180/270-degrees and flip the image horizontally or vertically. You can specify the type of rotation and flip to apply to the image. In order to rotate and flip the image you can load the converted JPEG image using the factory method exposed by [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class and call the Image.RotateFlip method while specifying the appropriate [RotateFlipType](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rotatefliptype).
