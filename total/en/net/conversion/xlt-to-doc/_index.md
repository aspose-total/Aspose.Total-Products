If you are working with Microsoft Excel, you may need to convert your files to the .doc format. The .doc format is the standard document format for Microsoft Word. When you convert your files to this format, you will be able to open them in Microsoft Word and edit them as needed.<br />

There are a few reasons why you might need to convert your files to the .doc format. One reason is that Microsoft Word can open and edit .doc files much more easily than .xlt files. Another reason is that .doc files are more widely compatible with other programs and devices.<br />

If you need to convert your .xlt files to .doc files, you can use the Aspose.Total for .NET API. This API makes it easy to convert files from one format to another. With just a few lines of code, you can convert your .xlt files to .doc files.
