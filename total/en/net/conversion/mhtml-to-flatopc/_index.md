Aspose.Total for .NET is a comprehensive suite of APIs that provides powerful document manipulation and conversion features for .NET applications. It includes the Aspose.PDF for .NET API, which enables developers to convert MHTML files to DOC format. This API is equipped with advanced features such as document compression, text extraction, and image extraction. 

Once the MHTML file is converted to DOC, the Aspose.Words for .NET API can be used to render the DOC file to FLATOPC. This API provides a wide range of features such as document conversion, document comparison, document merging, and document signing. It also supports a variety of document formats, including DOC, DOCX, ODT, HTML, and PDF. 

In addition to document manipulation and conversion, Aspose.Total for .NET also includes APIs for other tasks such as email processing, barcode generation, and image processing. These APIs provide features such as email conversion, barcode recognition, and image manipulation. 

Overall, Aspose.Total for .NET is a powerful suite of APIs that provides developers with a comprehensive set of features for document manipulation and conversion. It includes APIs for converting MHTML files to DOC, rendering DOC to FLATOPC, and performing other tasks such as email processing, barcode generation, and image processing. With these APIs, developers can easily add document manipulation and conversion features to their .NET applications.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt MHTML File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting MHTML to FLATOPC, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the MHTML using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.mhtml", "password");
// decrypt MHTML
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly FLATOPC- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your FLATOPC from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");

document.Save("output.flatopc", SaveFormat.FlatOpc);    
```
