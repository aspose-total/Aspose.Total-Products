{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt PS File using Owner Password via .NET" %}}
Before converting PS to MARKDOWN, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the PS using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly MARKDOWN- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your MARKDOWN from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Markdown
document.Save("output.markdown", SaveFormat.Markdown);    
```

**PS Format (Portable Document Format) files are used to store raster graphics information, making them ideal for creating static images and documents. However, when working with dynamic data, Markdown becomes essential for documentation and presentation.

The conversion of PS files into Markdown formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your documentation and presentation capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Documentation and Blogging**: Convert PS files to create interactive documentation, blog posts, and articles, featuring high-quality images and formatting.
*   **Presentations and Slideshows**: Use Markdown to create engaging presentations, slideshows, and talks, leveraging the versatility of text-based formats.
*   **Image Optimization and Compression**: Convert PS files to web-friendly formats, reducing file sizes and improving page load times for better user experiences.
*   **Content Management and Publishing**: Use Markdown to manage and publish content across multiple platforms, including websites, blogs, and social media channels.
*   **Accessibility and Inclusive Design**: Convert PS files to Markdown formats, ensuring that your documents and presentations are accessible to a wider audience and conform to inclusive design standards.
