Before converting CGM to MARKDOWN, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the CGM using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly MARKDOWN- File via .NET" %}}
In order to protect your MARKDOWN from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code %}}
```cs// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Markdown
document.Save("output.markdown", SaveFormat.Markdown);    
```

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) files are used to store vector graphics information, making them ideal for creating static graphics and illustrations. However, when working with dynamic data, spreadsheets like Excel become essential for data visualization and analysis.

The conversion of CGM files into Markdown formats is necessary to unlock the full potential of your data presentation and documentation capabilities. This conversion enables you to:

**Use Cases:**

*   **Static Graphics Documentation**: Convert CGM files to create detailed, interactive documentation for static graphics projects, making it easier for developers, designers, and stakeholders to collaborate.
*   **Data Storytelling**: Use Markdown to visualize complex data insights, creating engaging stories that convey key findings, trends, and patterns in the data.
*   **Digital Asset Management**: Convert CGM files to create a centralized hub for managing digital assets, such as vector graphics, logos, and icons, making it easier to track usage, updates, and revisions.
*   **Scientific Writing and Research**: Use Markdown to present complex scientific research findings, including 3D models, simulation results, and experimental data, in an easily understandable format for researchers, writers, and readers alike.
*   **Interactive Web Content Creation**: Convert CGM files to create interactive web content, such as animations, simulations, and visualizations, that engage users, convey complex information, and facilitate better understanding.
