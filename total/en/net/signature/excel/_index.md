#### Use Cases of Signing Spreadsheet Formats with Electronic Signatures

## Financial Reports and Budgets
XLS, XLSX, and ODS files are widely used for financial statements, balance sheets, and budgeting plans. Digital signatures confirm data accuracy and reviewer approval.

## Payroll and HR Data
Payroll summaries and HR analytics shared as spreadsheets can be signed electronically to ensure privacy and integrity during internal reviews or audits.

## Vendor Quotes and Procurement Sheets
Quotation forms, product lists, and cost estimates are often shared in spreadsheet format. Electronic signatures formalize acceptance and prevent post-submission edits.

## Audit and Compliance Records
Auditors use spreadsheets to compile and report findings. Digital signatures certify that the data hasn't been altered after approval.

## Inventory and Supply Chain Records
Inventory tracking files, shipping logs, and supplier data in ODS or XLSX formats are signed digitally to ensure consistency across operations and prevent data manipulation.
