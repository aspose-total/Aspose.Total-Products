#### RTF File Comparison for Cross-Platform Document Audits Use Cases:

RTF (Rich Text Format) files are widely used for lightweight document exchange. Comparing RTF files supports validation of content and formatting changes in environments where platform neutrality matters.

- **Cross-Platform Content Validation**  
  Detect formatting or wording changes across different systems or tools.

- **Documentation Revision Review**  
  Compare training manuals or help documents updated by multiple contributors.

- **Legacy Compatibility Audits**  
  Ensure changes made in RTF-based systems donâ€™t impact structure or style.
