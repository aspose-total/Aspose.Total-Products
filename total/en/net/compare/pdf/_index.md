#### PDF File Comparison for Document Integrity and Revision Control Use Cases:

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a standard for secure and consistent document sharing. Comparing PDF files is essential for identifying textual, layout, or annotation differences between versionsâ€”especially in legal, financial, or publishing environments.

- **Contract and Legal Document Review**  
  Highlight changes in clauses, terms, or formatting across different versions of contracts, agreements, or policies.

- **Regulatory Compliance Audits**  
  Detect unauthorized edits or missing content in compliance documents and regulatory submissions.

- **Publishing and Proofing**  
  Compare versions of books, brochures, or technical manuals to ensure all updates are reflected before final release.

- **Invoice and Financial Statement Validation**  
  Identify data modifications or additions in billing, reporting, and balance sheets to prevent discrepancies.

- **Academic and Research Document Revisions**  
  Track modifications in thesis drafts, research papers, or grant proposals between reviewers and authors.
