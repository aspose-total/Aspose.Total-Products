#### Use Cases: PPSM File Comparison for Macro-Enabled Slide Show Review

PPSM (PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Show) files are used for viewing presentations with automation enabled. Comparing PPSM files helps identify changes in macro behavior, timing sequences, and interactive content.

- **Macro Comparison Across Presentations**  
  Detect differences in automation routines triggered during slide shows.

- **Slide Content and Timing Validation**  
  Review changes in transition timings, animations, and sequence flows.

- **Automation Logic Review**  
  Compare embedded scripts and ensure consistent user experience in automated presentations.
