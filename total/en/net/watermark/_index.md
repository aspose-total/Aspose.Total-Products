Document watermarking is essential for various reasons across different file formats, including Microsoft Office documents, PDFs, and images. In Microsoft Office applications, watermarking adds a layer of security and authenticity to documents, deterring unauthorized use and providing a visible indicator of the document's status. For PDFs, watermarking contributes to document identification, branding, and confidentiality. Watermarks can contain information such as the document's status, authorship, or confidentiality level. In images, watermarking is crucial for protecting intellectual property, ensuring proper attribution, and preventing unauthorized use or distribution. Overall, document watermarking serves as a versatile and effective tool for enhancing document security, communication, and branding across diverse file formats.
