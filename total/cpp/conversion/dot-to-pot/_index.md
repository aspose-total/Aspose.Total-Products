Are you a C++ Developer looking to integrate Microsoft Word DOT to POT conversion feature inside your own applications? Do you want to convert your documents programmatically without installing Word or PowerPoint on your server or local machine? If yes, then, [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) powerful file automation APIs got your back. Using the APIs, you can develop applications for Windows 32 bit, Windows 64 bit, Linux 64 bit, and Intel x64 macOS platforms. In order to automate the rendering process, you can use the combination of two APIs to get your results in few simple steps. You can load your DOT file format by using [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) and convert it to HTML. After that by using PowerPoint manipulation C++ API [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as POT.

1. Open DOT file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class reference
2. Convert DOT to HTML by using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_stdbasicostream_saveoptions) member function
3. Initialize a new [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) object
4. Add an AutoShape in your slide, and add AddTextFrame in it
5. Load the HTML content and write it in your Presentation file
6. Save the document to POT format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation#afcd59ec697bf05c10f78c3869de2ec9e) method and set Pot as SaveFormat

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="Get Started with C++ File Format APIs" %}}
Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/cpp).

Apart from document conversion, [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) API allows tons of document manipulation features for C++ developers. In case your Microsoft Word DOT file format is password protected, you can still open it using the API. In order to load the encrypted document, you can use a special constructor overload, which accepts a [LoadOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.loading.load_options) object. This object contains the Password property, which specifies the password string. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C++ code to load password protected DOT file" %}}
```cs
// when loading password protected document, the password is passed to the document's constructor using a LoadOptions object.
auto options = MakeObject<LoadOptions>(u"docPassword");
// load the document from the local file system by filename:
SharedPtr<Document> doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"Encrypted.dot", options);
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add comments in POT document via C++" %}}
While saving DOT as POT, you can also use [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to add further features in your POT document. For instance, you can add comments in your presentation. The presentation slide comment are associated with a particular author. The Presentation class holds the collection of authors in ICommentAuthorCollection that are responsible for adding slide comments. For each author, there is a collection of comments in ICommentCollection.
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C++ code to add comments in POT document" %}}
```cs
// instantiate Presentation class
SharedPtr<Presentation>pres = MakeObject<Presentation>();
// access first slide
SharedPtr<ILayoutSlide>layout = pres->get_LayoutSlides()->idx_get(0);
// add empty slide
pres->get_Slides()->AddEmptySlide(layout);
// adding Author
SharedPtr<ICommentAuthor> author = pres->get_CommentAuthors()->AddAuthor(u"Ali", u"MF");
// set position of comments
System::Drawing::PointF point = System::Drawing::PointF(0.2f, 0.2f);
// add slide comment for an author on slide 1
author->get_Comments()->AddComment(u"Hello Ali, this is a slide comment", pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(1), point, DateTime::get_Now());
// access ISlide 1
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
// save presentation as Pot
pres->Save(output.pot, Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pot);
