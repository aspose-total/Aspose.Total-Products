Are you are a C++ developer looking to add email conversion features inside your applications? Are you looking for an API that can work on both Windows 64 bit & Linux 64 bit? Do you want to develop native C++ applications, without relying on Office Automation or Microsoft Outlook application? All of your questions can be solved by using [Aspose.Total for C++](https://products.aspose.com/total/cpp/) package of C++ File Format Automation libraries specifically designed to create, manipulate & convert popular formats. For this case, if you have an EMAIL file format and you want to export it as GIF programmatically, you can use the combination of two of the powerful APIs within the package. By using the first Email Processing API [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/), you can convert EMAIL file format to HTML. After that, by using enhanced Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/), you can export HTML to GIF.

1. Open EMAIL file using [MailMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message) class reference
2. Convert EMAIL to HTML by using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.mail_message#a7e7c6b50c8db5a8bcc6934db02b4a786) member function 
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) class 
4. Save the document to GIF format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document#save_string_saveformat) method and set Gif as SaveFormat

Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.Total.Cpp``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.Total.Cpp```.

Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/cpp).

```cs
// load the EMAIL file to be converted
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = MailMessage::Load(u"sourceFile.msg");
// save EMAIL as a HTML 
msg->Save(u"HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions::get_DefaultHtml());  
// load HTML with an instance of Document
System::SharedPtr<Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Document>(u"HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing Gif as save format

Not only you can convert your EMAIL to GIF, but you can read, manipulate, and parse EMAIL document. You can get subject, address, body, recipients information of the email by using MapiMessage class of [Aspose.Email for C++](https://products.aspose.com/email/cpp/) API.  For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using get_SenderEmailAddress() property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C# code to parse EMAIL file" %}}
```cs
// create an instance of MapiMessage from file
System::SharedPtr<MapiMessage> msg = MapiMessage::FromFile(dataDir + L"message.msg");
// get subject
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Subject:") + msg->get_Subject());
// get from address
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"From:") + msg->get_SenderEmailAddress());
// get body
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Body") + msg->get_Body());
// get recipients information
System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(L"Recipient: ") + msg->get_Recipients());

You can also add document protection features in your app while exporting the document from EMAIL to GIF. Adding protection to your document is a simple process, as all you need to do is apply the protection method to your document. You can set protection type to ReadOnly to restrict the user to edit the document.  
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C# code to protect GIF file format" %}}
```cs
// create a new document and protect it with a password.
auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// apply Document Protection.
doc->Protect(ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"password");
// save the document.
doc->Save(u"DocumentProtection.PasswordProtection.Gif");
```
