You can convert EPUB to PSD in Java in two simple steps. Firstly, by using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/), you can convert EPUB to JPEG. After that, by using [Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java/) Image Processing API, you can render JPEG to PSD. Both APIs come under the [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) package.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](JpegDevice) class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/JpegDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.Page-java.io.OutputStream-) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class 
4. Save the document to PSD format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method

You can easily use Aspose.Total for Java directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-total) based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.

Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/total/java).

The API also allows you to convert EPUB to PSD to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that you can convert your TIFF file to PSD. You can open the input file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [process](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice#process-com.aspose.pdf.IDocument-int-int-java.io.OutputStream-) method of [TiffDevice](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.devices/TiffDevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image)  class and save it to PSD format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.ImageOptionsBase-) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to PSD With Watermark via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB to PSD with watermark in your PSD document. In order to add an watermark to you can first convert EPUB to JPEG and add watermark in it. In order to add watermark, Load an image file using the [Image](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image) class, create an object of the [Graphics](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics) class and initialize it with Image object, create a new [Matrix](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Matrix) object and set translation and transformation to the desired angle and add watermark using [Graphics.drawString](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Graphics#drawString-java.lang.String-com.aspose.imaging.Font-com.aspose.imaging.Brush-float-float-) method. After adding the watermark in your image, you can save the JPEG as PSD format.
