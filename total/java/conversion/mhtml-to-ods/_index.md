By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can integrate MHTML to ODS conversion feature in your Java applications in two step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) you can render MHTML to XLSX. In the second step, you can convert XLSX to ODS by using Spreadsheet Programming API [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/).

1. Open MHTML file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class
2. Convert MHTML to XLSX by using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#save-java.lang.String-com.aspose.pdf.SaveOptions-) method
3. Load XLSX document by using [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class
4. Save the document to ODS format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method

While loading MHTML file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.
