Email conversion is a powerful feature that Java developers can integrate within any Java J2SE, J2EE, J2ME applications via [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/). By using two APIs within the package you can convert Email EMLX to DOT without any third party dependencies. Firstly, you can use Email Manipulation API [Aspose.Email for Java](https://products.aspose.com/email/java/) to convert EMLX file format to HTML. Secondly, you can render HTML to DOT by using Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/).

1. Open EMLX file using [MailMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mailmessage) class
2. Convert EMLX to HTML by using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/MailMessage#save(java.io.OutputStream,%20com.aspose.email.SaveOptions)) method
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to DOT format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method and set DOT as SaveFormat

```cs// load the EMLX file to be converted
MailMessage message = MailMessage.load("sourceFile.emlx"); 
// save EMLX as a HTML 
message.save("HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions.getDefaultHtml());
// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.DOT
document.save("output.dot", SaveFormat.DOT);
