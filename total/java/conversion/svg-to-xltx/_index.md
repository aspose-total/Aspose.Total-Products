By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can integrate SVG to XLTX conversion feature in your Java applications in two step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) you can render SVG to XLSX. In the second step, you can convert XLSX to XLTX by using Spreadsheet Programming API [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp/).

While loading SVG file format, your document might be password protected. [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) allows you open encrypted documents as well. In order to open the encrypted file, you can initialize new instance of the  [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document#Document-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) class and pass filename and password as arguments.
