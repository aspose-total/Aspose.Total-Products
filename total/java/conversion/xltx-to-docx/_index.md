Rendering XLTX to DOCX is a two step process. Youâ€™ll first use [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) API to convert the given XLTX document to PDF, and then by using [Aspose.Pdf for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java) API, you can easily convert your PDF document to DOCX. Both APIs come under the collection of [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) file format automation libraries.
