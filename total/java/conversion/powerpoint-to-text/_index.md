[Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) File Format Automation libraries empowers Java developers to automate the batch conversion process of PowerPoint POWERPOINT to Word TEXT. 
Rendering the document is a two step process and involves using two APIs. Weâ€™ll use [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) that is a PowerPoint API for presentations manipulation and management to convert POWERPOINT to HTML. After that by using feature-rich Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/) we will convert the HTML to TEXT.

1. Open POWERPOINT file using [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class
2. Convert POWERPOINT to HTML by using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation#save-java.lang.String-int-com.aspose.slides.ISaveOptions-) method and set Html as SaveFormat
3. Load the converted HTML file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class
4. Save the document to TEXT format using [save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,int)) method and set Text as SaveFormat
