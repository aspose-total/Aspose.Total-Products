By using [Aspose.Total for Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/java/) you can integrate MD to XLSM conversion feature in your Java applications in two step process. Firstly, by using [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java/) you can render MD to XLSX. In the second step, you can convert XLSX to XLSM by using Spreadsheet Programming API [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/).
