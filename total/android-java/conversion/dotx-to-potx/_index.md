Are you an Android developer looking to add a document conversion feature to your application? [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) File Format Automation libraries can help you automate the document conversion process in your Android applications. In order to convert DOTX file to POTX, you can first use document manipulation API [Aspose.Words for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/) to convert DOTX file format to HTML. After that by using PowerPoint API [Aspose.Slides for Android Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/android-java/), you can create a new Presentation, write HTML content in it, and save it as POTX.

You can also convert your password-protected DOTX to POTX within your Android applications. If your input DOTX document is password protected, you cannot convert it to POTX format without using the password. In order to open an encrypted document, you can set the correct password in the LoadOptions object and pass it to the Document constructor.

Within your Android applications, the API also allows you to perform DOTX file to POTX conversion with watermark. 
In order to add a watermark to your POTX document, you can first export DOTX to HTML and write HTML content in [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) object. After that to add a watermark, you can add text using addTextFrame, set all the relevant options like color, fillType and more and can save the document to POTX.
