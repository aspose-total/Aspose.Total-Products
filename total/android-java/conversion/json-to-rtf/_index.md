You can parse JSON to RTF in your Android applications in two-step process. Firstly, by using Powerful Spreadsheet Processing API [Aspose.Cells for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/android-java/) you can parse JSON to PDF. In the second step, you can convert PDF to RTF by using Word Processing API [Aspose.Words for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/android-java/). Both APIs come under [Aspose.Total for Android via Java](https://products.aspose.com/total/android-java/) product family.

1. Create a new [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object and read valid JSON data from file
2. Import JSON file to worksheet using [JsonUtility](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonUtility) class and [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) it as PDF 
3. Load PDF document by using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class 
4. Save the document to RTF format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document#save(java.lang.String,com.aspose.words.SaveOptions)) method

Furthermore, the API allows you to set layout options for your JSON format while parsing JSON to RTF using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse JSON Format to RTF with Watermark in Android via Java" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON to RTF with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your RTF document, you can first convert the JSON file to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/Document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.setText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to RTF.
