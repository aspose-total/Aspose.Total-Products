If you are a .NET developer looking to add document manipulation and conversion features inside your applications, [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) powerful file format manipulation APIs are the way forward. To be very specific, if you have an OFT file format and you want to save it as IMAGE, what options do you have? Furthermore, if you don't want to install any third party application including Word or Outlook in your local machine or server - achieving this document conversion task programmatically can be pretty hard. This is where two of the best APIs within the package come to rescue the developers. By using the first comprehensive Email Processing API [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/), you can convert OFT file format to HTML. After that, by using powerful Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/), you can render HTML to IMAGE. Please note that, by using these set of API, you can develop applications using .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin Platform including Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Mac.

1. Open OFT file using [MailMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage) class
2. Convert OFT to HTML by using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mailmessage/save/methods/3) method
3. Load HTML by using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class 
4. Save the document to PNG format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.document/save/methods/4) method and set Png as SaveFormat

```cs

MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load("sourceFile.oft");
// save OFT as a HTML 
message.Save("HtmlOutput.html", SaveOptions.DefaultHtml);
// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse OFT file via .NET " %}}
Before converting OFT to IMAGE, if you want to make sure that you are converting the correct email, you can load OFT document, parse it and have a look at your desired property. By using [MapiMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) class of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/email/net/) API, you can get sender and recipients information. For example, you can check for a specific sender email for the conversion by using [SenderName](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/properties/sendername) property. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C# code to parse OFT file" %}}
```cs
// instantiate MapiMessage to load an OFT file from disk
var outlookMessageFile = MapiMessage.FromFile("message.oft");
// check for SenderName 
if(outlookMessageFile.SenderName == "Ali"){
    //proceed with conversion process
}
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Restrict IMAGE document editing via .NET " %}}
While saving the document from OFT to IMAGE, you might need to protect your output document. Sometimes you may need to limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be useful to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document. [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API, enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C# code to protect IMAGE file format" %}}
```cs
// load HTML with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("HtmlOutput.html");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.Png
document.Save("output.png", SaveFormat.Png);  
```
