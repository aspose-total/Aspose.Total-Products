 In order to automate the process for any PowerPoint ppsm presentation to Word dotx files batch conversion , we’ll use [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net) and [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) APIs. The former is a PowerPoint presentation manipulation API that lets you create or modify Microsoft PowerPoint slides. Whereas, the latter is a word processing API for processing or manipulating Microsoft Word documents. Both APIs are part of [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net) package. You can directly [download](https://downloads.aspose.com/) from Nuget or may use the following commands from the Package Manager Console.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PPSM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/presentation/ppsm/" >}}
Files with PPSM extension represent Macro-enabled Slide Show file format created with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 or higher. Another similar file format is PPTM which differs in opening with Microsoft PowerPoint in editable format instead of running as Slide Show. When run as slide show, the PPSM file shows the presentation slides with contents intact in the slide show and is in read-only mode by default. PPSM files can still be edited in Microsoft PowerPoint by opening it in PowerPoint.
