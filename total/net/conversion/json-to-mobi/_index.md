By using [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can parse JSON format to MOBI  within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application in two simple steps. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/), you can export JSON to PDF. After that, by using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/), you can convert PDF to MOBI.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Set Layout and Parse JSON Format to MOBI via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also set layout options for your JSON format using [JsonLayoutOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.utility/jsonlayoutoptions). It allows you to process JSON Array as a table, ignore nulls, ignore array title, ignore object title, convert JSON string to number or date, set date and number format, and set title style. All of these options allow you to present your JSON data as per your needs. The following code snippet shows you how to set the layout options for JSON file format.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Parse JSON Format to MOBI with Watermark" %}}
Using the API, you can also parse JSON format to MOBI with watermark. In order to add a watermark to your MOBI document, you can first convert JSON to PDF and add a watermark to it. In order to add a watermark, load the newly created PDF file using the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class, create an instance of TextWatermarkOptions and set its properties, Call Watermark.SetText method and pass watermark text & object of TextWatermarkOptions. After adding the watermark, you can save the document to MOBI.
