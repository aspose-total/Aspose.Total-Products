Using [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can easily export EPUB to JPEG2000 within any .NET applications in two simple steps. First of all, by using [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/), you can export EPUB to JPEG. After that, by using [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net/) Image Processing API, you can convert JPEG to JPEG2000.

1. Open EPUB file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Initialize [JpegDevice](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/jpegdevice) class object and render EPUB to JPEG by using [Process](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.pagedevice/process/methods/1) method
3. Load JPEG file by using [Image](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
4. Save the document to JPEG2000 format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method

Using the API, you can also convert EPUB to JPEG2000 to a single file. In order to convert all pages, you can first render your EPUB document to one TIFF file and after that you can export TIFF file to JPEG2000. You can open the input file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class and create Resolution, TiffSettings, & TIFF device objects. You can get a single TIFF image using [Process](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices.documentdevice/process/methods/3) method of [TiffDevice](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.devices/tiffdevice) class. Finally, you can load TIFF file using [Image](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image) class 
and save it to JPEG2000 format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.image/save/methods/4) method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert EPUB to JPEG2000 With Watermark via C#" %}}
Using the API, you can also convert EPUB to JPEG2000 with watermark in your JPEG2000 document. In order to add a watermark, you can first render your EPUB document to JPEG and add a watermark in it. To demonstrate the operation, you can load your converted JPEG image, add transformations using an object of Matrix class and draw a string as the watermark on the image surface using the [Graphics](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class' [DrawString](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawstring) method. After adding the watermark in it, you can save the JPEG as JPEG2000 format.  Below is a code example that demonstrates how to add a diagonal watermark to your document.
