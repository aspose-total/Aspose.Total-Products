 In order to automate the process for any Word ott files to PowerPoint pptx presentation batch conversion , we’ll use [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) and [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net) APIs. The former is a word processing API for processing or manipulating Microsoft Word documents. Whereas, the latter is a presentation manipulation API that lets you create or modify Microsoft PowerPoint slides. Both APIs are part of [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net) package. You can directly [download](https://downloads.aspose.com/) from Nuget or may use the following commands from the Package Manager Console.
