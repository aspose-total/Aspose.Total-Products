By using [Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) you can include DOCX to XLSX conversion feature within any .NET, C#, ASP.NET and VB.NET application in two simple steps. Firstly, by using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/), you can export DOCX to HTML. After that, by using [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) Spreadsheet Programming API, you can convert HTML to XLSX.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Load DOCX Document from Stream  via C#" %}}
[Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) also allows you to load DOCX document via stream. To open a document from a stream, simply pass a stream object that contains the document into the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) constructor. The following code example shows how to open a document from a stream:

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Add Custom Properties in XLSX File via C#" %}}
While converting DOCX to XLSX, [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) enables you to add custom properties in your XLSX documents. In order to add a custom property, you can use [Add](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/customdocumentpropertycollection/methods/add/index) method for the [CustomDocumentPropertyCollection](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/customdocumentpropertycollection) class. The Add method adds the property to the Excel file and returns a reference for the new document property as an [Aspose.Cells.Properties.DocumentProperty](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/documentproperty) object.
