[Aspose.Total for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net/) is a powerful API to add document manipulation and conversion features inside your .NET application. If you have an XPS file format and you want to save it as FLATOPC without installing any third party app including Microsoft Word in your local machine or server, what options do you have? programmatically achieving this document conversion task can be a difficult job. Thanks to the two best APIs within the package, they come to rescue of the developers. Firstly, by using advanced PDF Processing API [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/), you can convert XPS file format to DOC. After that, by using powerful Document Processing API [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/), you can render DOC to FLATOPC.

1. Open XPS file using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class
2. Convert XPS to Doc by using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/5) method
3. Load Doc file by using [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document) class of Aspose.Words 
4. Save the document to FLATOPC format using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.document/save/methods/4) method and set FlatOpc as SaveFormat

```cs
// load XPS file with an instance of Document class
Document document = new Document("template.xps");
// save XPS as a DOC 
document.Save("DocOutput.doc", SaveFormat.Doc); 
// load Doc with an instance of Document
var outputDocument = new Aspose.Words.Document("DocOutput.doc");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.FlatOpc
outputDocument.Save("output.flatopc", SaveFormat.FlatOpc);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Decrypt XPS File using Owner Password via .NET " %}}
Before converting XPS to FLATOPC, if you want to decrypt your document you can do it by using the API. In order to decrypt the PDF file, you first need to create a [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object and open the XPS using the ownerâ€™s password. After that, you need to call [Decrypt](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/decrypt) method of the Document object. Finally, save the updated file using Save method of the Document object. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C# code to decrypt XPS file" %}}
```cs
// open document
Document document = new Document("Decrypt.xps", "password");
// decrypt XPS
document.Decrypt();
// save the decrypted document as doc 
document.Save("Decrypt_out.doc");

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Create ReadOnly FLATOPC via .NET " %}}
In order to protect your FLATOPC from editing and to prevent other people from editing sensitive and confidential information in your document, you can also set the protection of the document using the API. You can limit the ability to edit a document and only allow certain actions with it. This can be done using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) API. It enables you to control the way you restrict the content using the [ProtectionType](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/protectiontype) enumeration parameter. You can set your document to read-only by using the following lines of code. 
{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-code h3="C# code to protect FLATOPC file format" %}}
```cs
// load Doc with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("input.doc");
// apply document protection and set protection password
doc.Protect(ProtectionType.ReadOnly, "password");
// call save method while passing SaveFormat.FlatOpc
document.Save("output.flatopc", SaveFormat.FlatOpc);
